      <description>“Of course we’ve thought about this long and hard,” said Abby Hensel. “We’ve prayed about it and we’re confident that this is the right decision for us.” Her sister Brittany added, “You only live once and we just feel like it’s time.” Sisters Abby and Brittany Hensel are conjoined twins that have been defying expectations since the day they made their debut into this world. When they were born, they made international headlines for being one of the very few conjoined twins to survive the pregnancy and delivery processes.</description>

      <description>In 2008, Abby and Brittany began college at Bethel University, majoring in education. At first, the girls wanted to specialize in different fields, but upon learning about the additional coursework, they decided against it. “What’s funny, is that when we were little, I wanted to be a pilot,” said Abby. “And Brittany wanted to be a dentist. That didn’t last long.”
Their time at the University proved to be both rewarding and challenging as it is for most young people.</description>
