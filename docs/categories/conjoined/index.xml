      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    In 2008, Abby and Brittany began college at Bethel University, majoring in education. At first, the girls wanted to specialize in different fields, but upon learning about the additional coursework, they decided against it. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s funny, is that when we were little, I wanted to be a pilot,&amp;rdquo; said Abby. &amp;ldquo;And Brittany wanted to be a dentist. That didn&amp;rsquo;t last long.</description>

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    &amp;ldquo;We definitely have different styles,&amp;rdquo; says Abby. &amp;ldquo;Brittany&amp;rsquo;s a lot more into neutrals and pearls, stuff like that. But I would rather have it be more fun and bright and colorful!&amp;rdquo; While Abby is seen as the &amp;ldquo;outspoken&amp;rdquo; sister and will always win the argument about what they are going to wear, Brittany says her twin also has a softer side.</description>

We came into this world together, as a team, and we are just happy to have each other and our wonderful lives.&amp;rdquo;    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});   When the twins were first born, their parents had to decide if they wanted doctors to attempt surgical separation.</description>

      <title>6. Conjoined Twins: Shared Experiences</title>

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    For obvious reasons, Abby and Brittany Hensel have had to live as a team. Each girl controls one half of their body, so even the simple act of walking has to be coordinated. In fact, this is harder than it sounds because Brittany is a few inches shorter than Abby, requiring her to basically tip-toe.
That&amp;rsquo;s not all the girls have to deal with as a team.</description>

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    The twins recently announced that they had found work as part-time elementary school teachers. “We are fourth- and fifth-grade math specialists, so we’ll have two classes of math,&amp;rdquo; said Abby.
&amp;ldquo;It’s part time, which is nice, so we’ll be kind of transitioning into the teaching world,” Brittany added.

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    &amp;ldquo;People are not always so nice,&amp;rdquo; said Abby. &amp;ldquo;Human beings, by their very nature, are curious. So it&amp;rsquo;s understandable when people stare or ask to have their picture taken with us. That&amp;rsquo;s fine for the most part.&amp;rdquo; Brittany was quick to add, &amp;ldquo;But sometimes they say hurtful things, and if you let it, it can get you down.</description>

      <title>9. Conjoined Twins: Romance</title>
      <link>http://st.brainsation.com/post/conjoined-twins-romance/</link>

      <guid>http://st.brainsation.com/post/conjoined-twins-romance/</guid>
      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Though both have expressed a desire to one day get married and have children, they have been reluctant to discuss this issue publicly. Obviously, the subject inspires a lot of curiosity among strangers, which is perhaps why they don’t like to talk about it. And of course, it would raise a number of different ethical issues.

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    &amp;ldquo;If we each had a quarter for every untrue thing written about us online, believe me, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing the TLC show. We&amp;rsquo;d have already retired,&amp;rdquo; Abby said, laughing. These amazing women have overcome so many challenges to build the life that they enjoy today. It&amp;rsquo;s truly inspiring to witness their fortitude, grace, and humor!
