    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    If there’s one thing we can all agree on about the current Commander-in-Chief, it’s that he knows how to pull off an unusual expression. Here we see years of practice from being on _The Apprentice_ pay off with a classic “silly face” designed to distract people from what’s really going on.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    We could debate Paul Ryan’s job performance all day, but we’re not going to because it won’t change anyone’s mind. We will say, however, that he appears to have learned about the Animated GIF and then thrown himself into a performance begging for one on CNN.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    This was the moment when Sean Spicer was upstaged during his own press conference at the White House. Nobody cares about the President’s feelings regarding the “Iran review” when Rob Gronkowski’s on stage making his feelings clear about other matters. Poor Sean looks baffled. So no change there.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    We turn to Chinese television to bring you this wonderful moment when a stern-looking man faces down the camera only to be accidentally upstaged by a young woman. We particularly like the look of horror when she realizes followed by the rapid retreat. We hope she didn’t get fired for this.</description>

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Fox
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Can we get a round of applause for the guy at the back who appears to be sticking his tongue out as he waits for President Trump? This may actually be the best reason to shave a beard ever seen on TV. Things get stuck in it and when it gets uncomfortable, you do this and everyone thinks you’re a clown.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    We don’t think that it’s appropriate for us to comment on the relationship between the First Lady and President Trump. So, we’re going to let this GIF do the talking and let you draw your own conclusions. It is amazing how quickly a smile can disappear though, right?</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    When you’re involved in professional sports, you’re going to want to keep an eye on the game no matter what. So, you have to admire the dedication that goes on here – all the time wondering, “If he knew that this GIF would exist, would he have done the same thing?</description>

      <description>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Imgur
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    This serious-looking news reporter is simply upstaged by the world around him. The missing 6-year old is sadly forgotten the moment that the scene is photobombed, literally. A guy comes hurtling out of a window and lands badly, hitting the ground and looking very sorry that he has.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    We know that the world can be confusing today and that we all often find ourselves looking down at a screen and ignoring the people around us, but what’s this guy’s excuse? He just walks straight into this wall, like it’s an everyday thing for him.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    There’s Mary Ann Ahern reporting on the “Rally and Register,” whatever that was (have you ever noticed how yesterday’s news is all so irrelevant?) and in the background is her newest fan. A little girl who is determined to be on TV and wants to make sure that she’s busting a move when she does.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    We’re not sure what, exactly, was going on for this reporter, but whatever it was, it was clearly a huge surprise to find herself back on camera. Maybe she didn’t get the message that the commercial break was over? It’s a wonderful expression of her surprise though.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    TV reporters live glamorous lives and we’ve all envied them, just a little, when we’ve seen them reporting from a star-studded event and enjoying the limelight.
What many of us haven’t considered is that live-reporting his its dark side too. Live means that you can’t redo a take or reshoot a scene.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    This is rough justice for a would-be photo bomber. Running on screen might seem like a good idea, but not when it’s below zero and the street is covered in ice. Then you get to learn why it’s not a good idea while millions laugh at the lesson.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    It’s a hard world for women and they often struggle to be taken seriously in what were traditionally male roles such as sports reporting. Despite the great strides that women’s rights have made in thi areas, there’s always somebody looking to muscle in on the action.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Very creative work by the guy who interrupts this reporter. Seriously though, who happens to be walking around with that object and finds news cameras? Does this guy always have that object on him, just in case?

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    This female reporter has the camera panned over to her when she is unexpecting it. She apparently has some type of device (looks like a dildo) and when she notices the camera she quickly covers it up with her dress. This is definitely the most wild blooper I have ever seen!</description>

Behind him, however, is a lady who hasn’t read the script and she is calmly walking by until she pitches head over feet to the floor.</description>

    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    This has to be one of the risks of reporting from sporting events. People have had a few drinks and are more likely to try and interrupt the flow of the events just to get on TV. We like the photo bomber here because he comes back for a 2nd, even funnier appearance.</description>
