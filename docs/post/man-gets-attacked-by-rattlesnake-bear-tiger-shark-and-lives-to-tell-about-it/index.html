							<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the same may be said of luck. A twenty-year-old Colorado native named Dylan McWilliams may either be the most unlucky or luckiest man, reports <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/man-bitten-by-shark-previously-mauled-by-bear-and-bitten-by-a-snake-11342277">Sky News</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://politicsfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dylan-mcwilliams.jpg"><img src="http://politicsfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dylan-mcwilliams.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>On April 19, while enjoying a two week vacation to Hawaii, McWilliams was on his surfboard in the early morning waters of Shipwreck&rsquo;s Beach, 50 yards off of Poipu. The avid surfer and survival instructor was enjoying a beautiful morning when he suddenly felt something clamp down on one of his submerged legs. <strong>In the Eye of a Tiger</strong> The bite was a quick nibble in what was probably a &lsquo;test bite&rsquo; used by some sharks to gauge the reaction of prey. Upon being bit, McWilliams recalls seeing what he said was a tiger shark and noticed something else alarming. &ldquo;I was looking around and saw a bunch of blood. I didn&rsquo;t know if I lost half my leg or what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Describing his return ashore as the most scariest part of the ordeal, McWilliams was met on land by a bystander who called paramedics. The injuries to his leg, consisting of deep teeth marks, were not life threatening.</p>

<p><a href="http://politicsfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mcwilliamsshark1.png"><img src="http://politicsfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mcwilliamsshark1.png" alt="" /></a> <strong>Not the First Time&hellip;Or the Second</strong> McWilliams brush with death was not the first time. Just seven months before, the young awoke at a Colorado campsite to find the back of his head in the mouth of 300-lb black bear. Only after poking the bear in the eye did the beast let go of the young man, who ran off to join his camping group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/04/22/man-bitten-by-shark-bear-snake-in-less-than-4-years.html">Fox News</a> quotes McWilliams as saying, &ldquo;The bear grabbed the back of my head and started pulling me and I was fighting back as best as I could. It dropped me and stomped on me a little bit, and I was able to get back to the group and they scared it away.&rdquo; Miraculously, the incident only resulted in nine stitches to the back of his head.</p>

<p>Three-and-a-half years prior to this, while trekking in Utah, McWilliams received a glancing bite from a rattlesnake. The attack delivered just enough venom to make McWilliams ill, but it did not kill him like a full-on bite would have.</p>

<p>Interviewed by a local Hawaiian newspaper after the shark attack, McWilliams noted wryly, “I’m either really lucky or really unlucky.”</p>
