<p>While some friendships are as a result of the coming together of similar personalities, others are made up of the strangest of characters. This is the case when two animals from different species meet and form an unbreakable bond of friendship. The interspecies friendships are not only strong but also cute, a factor that makes them a source of inspiration even for humans. There have been several instances where animals of different species developed unbelievable bonds, with some interspecies friendships being termed as adoptions. Here are some of the cutest interspecies friendships of all time.</p>
