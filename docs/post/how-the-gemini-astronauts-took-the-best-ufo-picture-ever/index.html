							<p>In June of 1965 astronauts James McDivitt and Ed Pilot took part in the Gemini IV mission launched by NASA. The purpose of the mission was to show that humans could stay in space for extended lengths of time. It was the 2nd manned Gemini space flight and the 10th manned spaceflight by the US.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Gemini_4_-_White_und_McDivitt_in_Druckanzügen.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gemini_4_-_White_und_McDivitt_in_Druckanz%C3%BCgen.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a> For four days, McDivitt and White circled the Earth 66 times, and even took the first spacewalk ever by an American astronaut, as White floated free outside of the spacecraft for about 20 minutes. The reason people remember this mission and still talk about it to this day is because of the picture that McDivitt took out the capsule window. Here&rsquo;s how he described the event on the Dick Cavett Show (via Ancient Code): “I was flying with Ed White. He was sleeping at the time, so I don’t have anybody to verify my story. We were drifting in space with the control engines shut down, and all the instrumentation off (when) suddenly (an object) appeared in the window.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gemini4-mcdivitt-white-in-capsule-1024x755.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Astronauts_White_and_McDivitt_Inside_Gemini_IV_Spacecraft_-_GPN-2002-000031.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a> It had a very definite shape — a cylindrical object — it was white — it had a long arm that stuck out on the side. I don’t know whether it was a very small object up close or a very large object a long ways away.” “There was nothing to judge by. I don’t know how big it was. We had two cameras that were just floating in the spacecraft at the time, so I grabbed one and took a picture of (the object) and grabbed the other and took a picture. Then I turned on the rocket control systems because I was afraid we might hit it. At the time we were drifting — without checking I have no idea which way we were going — but as we drifted up a little farther the sun shone on the window of the spacecraft.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/mcdivitt-gemini-ufo-finally-viewable/">The Black Vault</a> “The windshield was dirty — just like in an automobile, you can’t see through it. So I had the rocket control engines going again and moved the spacecraft so that the window was in darkness again — the object was gone.” “I called down later and told them what had happened, and they went back and checked their records of other space debris that was flying around, but we were never able to identify what it could have been. The film was sent back to NASA and reviewed by some NASA film technicians. One of them selected what he thought was what we talked about, at least before I had a chance to review it. It was not the picture — it was a picture of a sun reflection on the window.”</p>

<p><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/paranormal/2013/10/another-astronaut-reports-an-alien-craft-encounter-2457808.html">BeforeItsNews.com</a> Wow&hellip; so, not only did NASA and the government try to pass off the image as &ldquo;space junk,&rdquo; the intentionally released the wrong photo and tried to paint McDivitt, a brigadiere general, as some sort of idiot taking pictures of reflections. What do you think? Did McDivitt get a picture of an actual alien spacecraft?</p>
