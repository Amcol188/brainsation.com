<p>It takes a lot of hard work and training to become a doctor. But to become a doctor with your own television show? Now that&rsquo;s tough. Thankfully, our favorite medical media personalities seem to earn back what they put into their programs (and then some)! Ever wondered what Dr. Phil earns in a year, or the net worth of hunky former <em>Bachelor</em> contestant Travis Stork? We&rsquo;ve got the dirt!</p>

<h2 id="dr-phil-had-a-humble-beginning">Dr. Phil Had A Humble Beginning&hellip;</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/philmcgrawhwofmay2013-1496856256356-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PhilMcGrawHWOFMay2013.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Dr. Phil McGraw &ndash; better known as just plain old Dr. Phil &ndash; is one of the best-known and original television self-help gurus. After earning his PhD in clinical psychology at the University of North Texas, he got his start in showbiz by working as a legal consultant for Oprah in the mid-90s. By 2002, he had his own show, which continues to be extremely popular. How much does he make? Find out on the next slide.</p>

<h2 id="with-a-lucrative-ending">&hellip;With A Lucrative Ending</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/philrobinmcgrawhwofmay2013-1496856345688-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PhilRobinMcGrawHWOFMay2013.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Dr. Phil isn&rsquo;t just one of the world&rsquo;s richest celebrity doctors &ndash; he&rsquo;s one of the world&rsquo;s richest celebrities, period. In 2015, <em>Forbes</em> estimated his annual income at $70 million per year, making him the 15th-highest paid celebrity that year. In 2016, his total net worth was valued over $400 million. You know our next doctor, and while he&rsquo;s not as rich as Dr. Phil, he&rsquo;s worth more than you think!</p>

<h2 id="the-son-of-turkish-immigrants">The Son Of Turkish Immigrants</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/524px-mehmet_oz_-_world_economic_forum_annual_meeting_2012-1496856483607-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mehmet_Oz_-_World_Economic_Forum_Annual_Meeting_2012.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Like Dr. Phil before him, Dr. Mehmet Oz got his start by appearing on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> before getting his own network programming. He earned his MD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, specializing in cardiothoracic surgery. Now, he rakes in the big bucks, often by touting controversial remedies&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="a-little-too-popular">A Little Too Popular?</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2851358847_50d0e17e99_b-1496856571534-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidberkowitz/2851358847">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Dr. Oz has been ranked among the most influential people in the world by both <em>Time</em> and <em>Esquire</em> magazines. Between his television appearances, books, and sponsorships, he earns about $4 million every year. He has an estimated net worth somewhere between $7 million and $14 million, even after he was called into a U.S. Senate hearing on consumer protection.</p>

<h2 id="paging-dr-love-anyone">Paging Dr. Love, Anyone?</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drtravisstorkbyphilkonstantin_-cropped-1496856712730.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DrTravisStorkByPhilKonstantin_(cropped).jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Dr. Travis Stork got his media debut in a rather unusual way for a doctor: He was the hunky candidate on season 8 of <em>The Bachelor</em>. Even though the romance didn&rsquo;t work out for him, the cameras certainly loved him. After a few appearances on <em>Dr. Phil</em>, he was chosen to host _The Doctors _in 2007.</p>

<h2 id="smart-handsome-rich-and-still-single">Smart, Handsome, Rich&hellip; And Still Single</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/612061539_1280x720-1496856824920-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/198943020">Vimeo</a></p>

<p>Just 45 years old, Dr. Stork is now worth an estimated $8 million. That&rsquo;s not bad for the son of Midwestern farmers who graduated magna cum laude from Duke University. Two of his books, _The Lean Belly Prescription _and <em>The Doctor&rsquo;s Diet</em>, have both made the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller List. You&rsquo;ve seen our next doctor just about everywhere, but we bet you don&rsquo;t know how much he has packed away!</p>

<h2 id="medical-journalist-extraordinaire">Medical Journalist Extraordinaire</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dr_sanjay_gupta-1496856936315-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dr._Sanjay_Gupta.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta is best known as the chief medical correspondent for CNN and a frequent talking head on shows like <em>60 Minutes</em>, the <em>Late Show with David Letterman</em>, and <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em>. But his resume runs deeper than that: He completed his schooling at the University of Michigan and is a practicing neurosurgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. With all that and more, he earns a pretty penny for his family.</p>

<h2 id="no-thanks-obama">No Thanks, Obama</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sanjay_guptamake-1496857033101-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanjay_Gupta@MAKE.jpeg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>A neurosurgeon, a journalist, a professor, and even a bestselling novelist, Dr. Gupta is reported to have a $4.5 million net worth. In 2008, he was even considered for the U.S. Surgeon General position under Barack Obama &ndash; but turned down the job, content to focus on his family and current career. You&rsquo;ve probably been wondering when Dr. Drew is going to show up on the list &hellip;</p>

<h2 id="love-on-the-line-with-dr-drew">Love On The Line With Dr. Drew</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dr_drew_by_randy_stewart-1496857143270-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dr._Drew_by_Randy_Stewart.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Drew Pinsky, M.D. &ndash; better known as Dr. Drew &ndash; got his start in media while still a medical student. He started his popular radio show _Loveline _back in the mid-1980s, and continued to host it until 2016. He&rsquo;s also well known for his television appearances, such as <em>Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew</em>, and together he makes quite the decent living doing it.</p>

<h2 id="all-that-and-a-family-man-too">All That And A Family Man, Too</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drdrew1secondfilm-1496857241443-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DrDrew1SecondFilm.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>All told, Dr. Drew&rsquo;s net worth is somewhere in the ballpark of $20 million. He lives in Pasadena, California, with his wife and teenaged triplets. Along with his media work, he continues to serve as a private practitioner, too. But like the rest of the TV doctors on this list, he definitely owes a debt to the woman on the next slide.</p>

<h2 id="getting-some-since-1980">Getting Some Since 1980</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dr_ruth_westheimer_2009-1496857347876-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dr._Ruth_Westheimer_2009.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>  The lovable Dr. Ruth Westheimer was a pioneer in the sex education world. She started broadcasting her first radio program, <em>Sexually Speaking</em>, on WYNY-FM in 1980. Eventually, the show went national and she got her own weeknight talk show, too. Now 89 years young, she continues to live and teach in New York City.</p>

<h2 id="an-unthinkable-past">An Unthinkable Past</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ruthwestheimer-a-1496857438449-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RuthWestheimer-a.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Between her many popular books, programs, and lectures, Dr. Ruth rests easy on a $3 million net worth. She&rsquo;s been married three times and has two kids. Born to a Jewish German family in 1928, she managed to escape Nazi rule by fleeing to Switzerland. Her parents, unfortunately, were not so lucky.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-age-guru">The New Age Guru</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/deepak_chopra-1496857548073-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Deepak_Chopra.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Dr. Deepak Chopra is one of the most well-known figures of the New Age and holistic medicine movement. After earning his M.D. in his native India, he immigrated to the U.S. and completed his residency in New Jersey. He developed a huge following after appearing on &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>.</p>

<h2 id="natural-medicine-natural-money">Natural Medicine, Natural Money</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/290768422_54203c90f9_b-1496857656158-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/yodelanecdotal/290768422">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Chopra is the author of over 80 books, 21 of which have gone on to become bestsellers. He&rsquo;s also a regular contributor to the_ Washington_ _Post _and <em>Huffington Post</em>. He left his job at the New England Memorial Hospital in 1985 in order to found the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and it seems to have worked out for him so far: He&rsquo;s worth $50 million today.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-supplement-to-start-your-day">A Little Supplement To Start Your Day</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/588734421_1280x720-1496857788105-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/180495392">Vimeo</a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for someone to blame for the aisles of nutritional supplements now rampant in every grocery store across America, it&rsquo;s probably Dr. Andrew Weil. He&rsquo;s a big believer in holistic health and integrative medicine. He studied at Harvard Medical School, but is very critical of traditional medicine. Turns out, so are many people willing to pay for his products.</p>

<h2 id="take-a-walk-on-the-alternative-side">Take A Walk On The Alternative Side</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4874376905_dd090df350_b-1496857901904-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/37689135@N07/4874376905">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Dr. Weil is worth an estimated $10 million today. His many appearances on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, <em>The Today Show</em>, and <em>Larry King Live</em> helped bring his alternative health messages to a broader audience. His website <em>Ask Dr. Weil</em> was named one of <em>Forbes</em>&rsquo; &ldquo;Best of the Web&rdquo; in 2009. Alternative medicine pays well, but how about couple&rsquo;s therapy? Can you guess who&rsquo;s up next?</p>

<h2 id="a-divorced-marriage-therapist">A Divorced Marriage Therapist</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/untitled-1496858265127-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vh1.com/video-clips/6flagw/couples-therapy-with-dr-jenn-couples-therapy-with-dr-jenn-season-5-juan-pablo-nikki">VH1</a></p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t look away from the trainwrecks on VH1&rsquo;s <em>Couples Therapy</em>. Host Jenn Mann (formerly known as Jenn Berman, until her own divorce in 2013) is a licensed psychotherapist with her own private practice in Los Angeles. She&rsquo;s also regularly seen on shows like <em>The Early Show</em> and <em>The Today Show</em>.</p>

<h2 id="you-ve-lost-that-loving-feeling">You&rsquo;ve Lost That Loving Feeling</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/carolebayersagercarolekingcynthiaweilbarrymannhwofdec2012-1-1496858674924.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CaroleBayerSagerCaroleKingCynthiaWeilBarryMannHWOFDec2012.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Just how much Dr. Jenn makes in a year we can&rsquo;t completely say, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure: she&rsquo;s not strapped for cash. Her parents, songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, are worth a combined $100 million. And in her divorce settlement, ex-beau Joshua Berman received more than $588,000.</p>

<h2 id="venus-de-new-jersey">Venus de New Jersey</h2>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/v-1496858880255-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpTVBedGB7M">YouTube</a></p>

What&rsquo;s she earn for putting up with all this? Click through to find out.</p>
