							<p>With Kilauea erupting and Yellowstone trembling, reports of another earthquake really aren&rsquo;t that surprising. The location, however, is something of a head scratcher. On Sunday, the U.S. Geological Survey, reported that an earthquake took place 160 miles southeast of New Orleans and 120 miles southeast of Grand Isle.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/new-orleans-quake-map.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://weather.com/news/news/2018-05-06-new-orleans-earthquake-gulf-of-mexico">The Weather Channel</a> The 4.9 quake was also reported by the National Tsunami Warning Center, but it was not strong enough to create a real threat of a tsunami. In addition, scientists recorded a 5.6 quake 21 miles from Conchague, El Salvador on Sunday and a 6.1 earthquake 83 miles from the Philippines on Saturday. With all of this talk of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes around the globe, many are starting to wonder if there&rsquo;s a more ominous, cataclysmic event lurking somewhere on the horizon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.maxpixel.net/Volcano-Outdoors-National-Park-Hawaii-Kilauea-3088675">Max Pixel</a> Many amateur seismologist predict that that supervolcano under Yellowstone, which is overdue for an eruption, is about to blow, and even the experts are issuing warnings about possible disaster scenarios playing out in the near future. Earthquake expert Dr Lucy Jones has long predicted that California is due for a 7.5 to 8.2 strength earthquake in its not so distant future, yet no one is able to predict exactly when or where that will take place, and that&rsquo;s what makes them so scary.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earthquake_damage_in_Jacmel_2010-01-17_3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earthquake_damage_in_Jacmel_2010-01-17_3.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a> Nowhere is this fear currently more evident than on the big island of Hawaii. More than 250 quakes struck the island on Wednesday and over 400 in a 24 hour period on Friday including a big 6.9 quake. With Kilauea continuing to erupt, experts are wondering what more lay in store. From the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/956266/Hawaii-volcano-eruption-another-earthquake-lava-toxic-gas-leilani-estates">Daily Express</a>: More than 10 eruptions rocked the area on Sunday, spewing lava more than 230 feet into the air from one of the volcanoes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/slworking/4191800237">Flickr - slworking</a> The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported Sunday night that lava fountains shooting from at least one fissure continued through the day, finally stopping about 4 p.m. Meanwhile, video captured earlier in the weekend showed eruptions gobbling up streets, cars, homes and utility poles. And at one of the fissures, a lava flow advanced from about 5am to 10am Sunday, traveling north-northeast for more than half a mile. Earthquake activity on the Big Island continued through the weekend, though the frequency of quakes has lessened today. In the 24 hours ending at 9pm on Sunday, Big Island saw roughly 31 small earthquakes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.maxpixel.net/Volcano-Outdoors-National-Park-Hawaii-Kilauea-3088675">Max Pixel</a> A large, 6.9-magnitude quake hit Hawaii Island on Friday afternoon, just an hour after another sizeable quake sent lava spewing into streets and threatened homes. The tremor, which happened about 12:30 p.m., was the largest in Hawaii since 1975 and generated small tsunami waves around Big Island. Hawaii County Civil Defense said sea fluctuations ranged from 8 inches in Hilo to 16 inches at Kapoho. For those who have evacuated, the mayor said the county plans to house and feed them for &ldquo;as long as we need to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Is there something bigger heading our way?</p>

<p>Where do you think it will take place?</p>
