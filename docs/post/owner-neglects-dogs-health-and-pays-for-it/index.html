Please share your thoughts with us at the bottom of this post!</h3>

<p>Most pet owners care for their furry friends as if they were born into the family. In fact, in the past several decades, this had led to the explosive growth of the pet industry. Nowadays, owners are able to treat their pets with many of the same luxuries that people enjoy. If you&rsquo;re a pet owner, then you understand where this is going. Just think about all the way in which we can insure the life of our pets.</p>

<h3 id="most-people-treat-their-pets-like-family-and-go-to-great-lengths-to-keep-their-four-legged-friends-happy">Most people treat their pets like family and go to great lengths to keep their four legged friends happy</h3>

<p>How exactly has the pet industry evolved to reflect the demand of pet owners? For starters, many companies offer pet insurance. Owners can easily buy dog insurance, cat insurance, and pretty much coverage for any type of creature. In fact, more recently, even pet dental insurance has become widely available, allowing owners to purchase policies for their cat or dog&rsquo;s teeth - just like a parent would for a child. This level of pet care is a testament to the growing appreciation and love for pets.</p>

Take 59 year old millionaire, Christina Fay, who recently came face to face with the law.</h3>

<h3 id="christina-fay-claimed-to-be-an-ethical-dog-breeder-of-great-danes-yet-a-courtroom-decided-otherwise">Christina Fay claimed to be an ethical dog breeder of Great Danes. Yet a courtroom decided otherwise.</h3>

<p>Unlike typical loving pet owners, who provide pet health care, pet insurance, dental insurance, pet food, proper pet grooming, and, above all, humane treatment to their animals, Christina Fay was found guilty for being an abusive owner.</p>

<h3 id="cornered-by-police-fay-s-ex-employee-had-few-options-other-than-to-oblige-to-the-authority-s-requests">Cornered by police, Fay&rsquo;s ex-employee had few options other than to oblige to the authority&rsquo;s requests&hellip;.</h3>

<p>Based on reports from neighbors and the evidence discovered during the investigation, I imagine that pet food wasn&rsquo;t going to fill the bellies of all the hungry Great Danes. Although later, Lee testified that the dogs were given pet food, water, and medical care - the guilty verdict might suggest otherwise. And</p>

<p>based on the pictures of these emaciated dogs, clearly they did not receive the pet medical attention they deserved and required to keep them healthy.</p>

<h3 id="leading-up-to-this-point-several-of-christina-fay-s-6-employees-had-quit-perhaps-they-disagreed-with-the-treatment-the-dogs-were-receiving">Leading up to this point, several of Christina Fay&rsquo;s 6 employees had quit. Perhaps they disagreed with the treatment the dogs were receiving.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;She abused 75 Great Danes, that&rsquo;s how many dogs they took from her. We are sick and tired of rich people thinking they can do whatever they want,&rdquo; local resident Deanna Richardson said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a crowd out here, we want her to go to jail.&rdquo; When millionaireÂ dog breeder Christina Fay was sentenced for abusing 75 Great Danes she kept as prisoners in her enormous mansion, she immediately appealed that verdict. Well, a second jury has taken a look at the evidence and affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s decision. A crowd of localÂ Wolfeboro residents cheered the verdict outside the courthouse&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b-9.jpg"><img src="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b-9.jpg" alt="" /></a> Here&rsquo;s</p>

<p>the real deal per <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/jury-convicts-woman-of-animal-cruelty-in-great-danes-case/19410498">WMUR</a>: <em>A jury in the trial of a woman who had dozens of filthy and sick Great Danes living in her New Hampshire mansion has convicted her of 17 counts of animal cruelty.</em> <em>Christina Fay, 59, was convicted of the misdemeanors on Monday. Her sentencing hasn&rsquo;t been scheduled.</em> <em>Last year, a lower court judge found Fay guilty of multiple animal cruelty charges. He ordered her to pay nearly $800,000 for their care. Fay said she took care of the dogs, and she appealed to a superior court for a jury trial.</em> <em>Prosecutors showed images of the dogs living in squalid conditions, with animal waste coating the floors.</em> <em>The jury recently toured Fay&rsquo;s 13,000-square-foot home in Wolfeboro. Most of the hardwood floors were removed, and most roomsÂ were empty.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-9.jpg"><img src="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-9.jpg" alt="" /></a> In</p>

<p>2017, Mrs. Fay was found guilty by a lower court. Here&rsquo;s the scoop on that verdict from the <a href="https://www.conwaydailysun.com/news/local/fay-gets-months-suspended-must-pay/article_a9c3a900-e669-11e7-b9da-cfd7942cc572.html">Conway Daily Sun</a>: <em>Christina Fay, the woman recently convicted of 10 counts of animal cruelty for her mistreatment of numerous Great Danes, was sentenced by a circuit judge Thursday to a year in jail, though he suspended all 12 months.</em> <em>Of the approximately 75 dogs that were seized from her Wolfeboro home by police and members of The Humane Society of the United States, Circuit Judge Charles Greenhalgh is allowing Fay, 59, to keep just one, as long as it is spayed or neutered.</em> <em>Greenhalgh also ordered Fay to pay the entire amount that the prosecution had asked for, totaling over three-quarters of a million dollars. The HSUS seeks $770,000; the town of Wolfeboro, about $16,300; and the Pope Memorial SPCA of Concord Merrimack County, about $1,500.Â </em></p>

<p><a href="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d-6.jpg"><img src="http://sopawfect.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d-6.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We are glad to see that justice has been served in this case and that the higher court affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s ruling. This woman deserves a harsh sentence for abusing these 75 Great Danes! The conditions inside that enormous house were absolutely horrendous!</p>

<p><strong>How much time should she get in jail?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Can you believe the first judge allowed her to keep one dog?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Would you donate a bag of dog food to these starving pups?!</strong></p>
