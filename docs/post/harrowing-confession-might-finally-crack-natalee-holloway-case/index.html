<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-27-1499446899402.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz6wxJQHHwA">YouTube</a> What makes Joran so unusual is how he changes his stories a lot—more than 20 times. In an interview with Fox News, he even said that he sold Natalee into slavery for $10,000.</p>

<h2 id="joran-commits-murder-in-peru">Joran Commits Murder In Peru</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/peru-murder-1499445990712.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXZ1E9YLHaE">YouTube</a> On May 30, 2010, exactly five years since Natalee disappeared, Joran killed a female student in Peru.

<h2 id="a-new-eyewitness">A New Eyewitness</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-30-1499447423065.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKg6vFrEO2Q">YouTube</a> Jurrien de Jong, a man formerly involved in the drug trade, went to authorities in May 2015 as a witness. He said he saw Joran carrying Natalee&rsquo;s body through a locked construction site.</p>

<h2 id="no-construction-site">No Construction Site</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-31-1499447598263.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKg6vFrEO2Q">YouTube</a> After investigating de Jong&rsquo;s claims, the Chief Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office said that there was no construction at that location on May 30, 2005. The statement effectively disproved de Jong&rsquo;s testimony.</p>

<h2 id="natalee-s-father-believes-there-was-construction">Natalee&rsquo;s Father Believes There Was Construction</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-33-1499448109787.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKg6vFrEO2Q&amp;t=206s">YouTube</a> Dave Holloway said he remembered the site mentioned by de Jong. He even argued that a satellite image taken in June 2005 from Google Earth showed an outline that could very well be the construction site.</p>

<h2 id="case-remains-unsolved">Case Remains Unsolved</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-32-1499447874089.jpg" alt="" /></p>
