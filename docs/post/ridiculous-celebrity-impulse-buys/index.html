<p><a href="http://amcol.wpengine.com/ridiculous-celebrity-impulse-buys/2"><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/593f55bb8a87a_bono-hat-glasses-1496799581227.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all impulsively bought that pack of gum while waiting in line at the supermarket. But imagine if you had millions of dollars burning in your pocket. What would you spend it on? If celebrities are any example, it&rsquo;d probably be something pretty ridiculous. From pet cobras to blinged-out bathtubs, here are some of the most extravagant celebrity impulse buys on record.</p>

<h2 id="and-one-1-700-plane-ticket-for-my-hat-please">And One $1,700 Plane Ticket For My Hat, Please</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bono-hat-glasses-1496799581227-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bono-hat-glasses.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Most normal humans, if they left their favorite hat at home when they went on vacation, would just go without &ndash; or maybe pick up a tacky souvenir one on the way.</p>

<p>Not Bono, though. The U2 singer and noted environmental activist spent $1,700 on a plane ticket just for his hat to get to him sooner.</p>

<h2 id="the-100-000-golden-legs-of-queen-bey">The $100,000 Golden Legs Of Queen Bey</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1280px-beyonce_concert_in_central_park_2011_good_morning_americas_summer_co-1496799860878-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BEYONCE_CONCERT_IN_CENTRAL_PARK_2011_Good_Morning_America%27s_Summer_Concert_Series_-_Central_Park,_Manhattan_NYC_-_070111.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Beyonce looks good in just about everything. Does she really need to go and spend $100,000 on a pair of leggings? Apparently the answer is yes, because that&rsquo;s precisely what she wore for her 2007 BET Awards performance. But once you hear about the spending habits of her husband and friends on this list, you might not be so surprised.</p>

<h2 id="every-toddler-deserves-an-850-designer-purse">Every Toddler Deserves An $850 Designer Purse</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tom_cruise__katie_holmes_whcad-1496800120634-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/47084925@N00/3518728500/">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Plenty of little girls like having a purse, just like their mom. But young Suri Cruise, daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, got more than just the old hand-me-downs. Her mom bought her a $850 Salvatore Ferragamo purse when she was just three years old &ndash; perfect for stashing leftover crackers, right?</p>

<h2 id="just-a-simple-helicopter-for-the-family">Just A Simple Helicopter For The Family</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/joliepitt-1496800304580-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JoliePitt.png">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Back before the great Brangelina split of 2017, the couple showed their affection by buying each other lavish gifts that most of us could never dream of.</p>

<p>In 2012, for instance, Angelina got Brad his own $1 million helicopter, reportedly so that he could commute to and from Cannes more easily.</p>

<h2 id="need-for-speed-and-a-hefty-pricetag">Need For Speed &ndash; And A Hefty Pricetag</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chris_brown_-6933798786-1496800489430-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/evarinaldiphotography/6933798786/">Flickr</a></p>

<p>In 2009, Chris Brown treated himself to a $1.5 million dollar sports car &ndash; one of the most expensive luxury vehicles ever made by automobile company Bugatti. Now, the brand has a new $2.3 million car on the market.</p>

<p>Do you think he&rsquo;ll trade in for an upgrade?</p>

<h2 id="paris-famous-purse-puppies">Paris&rsquo; Famous Purse Puppies</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/paris_hilton_3_crop-1496800659416-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paris_Hilton_3_Crop.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>We have to credit Paris Hilton for at least one thing: Inventing the purse dog. In fact, the teacup Pomeranian she purchased in 2009 cost $10,000.</p>

<p>That seems like a lot for an animal who makes you clean up their poop. But if this list proves anything, it&rsquo;s that celebs <em>love</em> spending wads of cash on their precious pets &ndash; wait and see!</p>

<h2 id="gaga-for-ghosts-not-so-much">Gaga For Ghosts? Not So Much</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5712066016_d2c8892d1a_z-1496800820232-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stevegarfield/5712066016">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Lady Gaga isn&rsquo;t just weird on stage &ndash; she&rsquo;s weird off of it, too. The star spent a reported $50,000 on electromagnetic field equipment meant to keep spirits like ghosts away from her while she&rsquo;s out on tour. She also believes herself to be the reincarnated spirit of her dead aunt.</p>

<h2 id="all-i-want-for-christmas-is-a-125-million-mansion">All I Want For Christmas Is A $125 Million Mansion</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21786507289_821dd09940_b-1496801057984-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/celebrityabc/21786507289">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Mariah Carey certainly knows how to pick &lsquo;em. She and her former beau Nick Cannon bought a $125 million home in Los Angeles that contains six bedrooms, a movie theater, a basketball court, and a gym.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for celebs to have pricey homes &ndash; but even Oprah&rsquo;s $80 million Montecito mansion seems modest by comparison.</p>

<h2 id="99-problems-but-a-drink-ain-t-one">99 Problems But A Drink Ain&rsquo;t One</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jay-z_2011-1496801125002-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jay-Z_2011.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Jay-Z is much more than just a rapper: he&rsquo;s also a serial entrepreneur with his own record label, clothing line, real estate investments, and even sports team.</p>

<p>Like any businessman, he probably likes to unwind at the end of the day with a nice drink: But in his case, it&rsquo;s a glass of bubbly from a $250,000 Armand de Brignac champagne.</p>

<h2 id="the-boy-who-lived-and-slept-on-a-17-000-mattress">The Boy Who Lived And Slept On A $17,000 Mattress</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/daniel_radcliffe_2011_-straighten_colors-1496801427975-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ellasportfolio/6345945115/">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Sure, when you start making a six-figure salary at age 11 like Daniel Radcliffe did, a nice mattress might not seem like a big deal. But can you imagine spending $17,000 on the thing you use to sleep on? At least we can rest easy knowing Harry Potter is getting his beauty sleep.</p>

<h2 id="spice-up-your-cell-phone-with-24-karat-gold">Spice Up Your Cell Phone With 24-Karat Gold</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/victoria_beckham_-headshot-1496801671436-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Victoria_Beckham_(Headshot).jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>And you thought the new iPhone was expensive. Victoria Beckham, perhaps better known as Posh Spice, spent nearly $36,000 on her cell phone, designed by artist Stuart Hughes and plated in real 24-karat gold. Can you hear me now?</p>

<p>Click through to see the other gold accessories coming up on the list.</p>

<h2 id="being-in-the-doghouse-isn-t-so-bad-after-all">Being In The Doghouse Isn&rsquo;t So Bad After All</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/541px-rachel_hunter_lf-1496801821632-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rachel_Hunter_LF.JPG">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>New Zealand-born model and actress Rachel Hunter has appeared on the cover of the <em>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue</em> twice, and on the cover of _Playboy _once &ndash; but it&rsquo;s her dog that really lives in the penthouse. She had a smaller replica of her own mansion specially designed for her German Shepherd to the tune of $15,000.</p>

<h2 id="ashton-the-astronaut">Ashton The Astronaut?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/819px-ashton_kutcher_by_david_shankbone-1496802045084-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Kutcher">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>No, you are not being <em>Punk&rsquo;D</em>: Ashton Kutcher really is signed up to go to space. He spent $200,000 back in 2012 to register as the 500th &ldquo;astronaut&rdquo; on board the Virgin Galactic commercial spacecraft &ndash; if and when it ever launches, that is. In the meantime, you can visit a real castle on the next slide.</p>

<h2 id="the-international-treasures-of-nicolas-cage">The International Treasures of Nicolas Cage</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1102px-nicolas_cage_2010-1496802184959-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nicolas_Cage_2010.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>The next time your parents chastise you for being financially irresponsible, direct them to the story of Nicolas Cage. The actor earned over $150 million between 1996 and 2011, and somehow managed to spend every last penny (and then some).</p>

<p>Among the purchases: An 11th-century Bavarian castle; a dinosaur skull; a million-dollar comic book collection; a luxury yacht; and two pet cobras.</p>

<h2 id="never-say-never-to-a-5-000-halloween-costume">Never Say Never To A $5,000 Halloween Costume</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/6175343447_4525fc59f9_z-1-1496802372411-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67926342@N08/6175343447">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Justin Bieber is not exactly known for making the most rational decisions, but you&rsquo;ve got to give him credit for following through on them. For his Halloween costume in 2011, for example, he ordered a custom-made gold grill from a Los Angeles jeweler that cost $5,000. Let&rsquo;s hope he got the most out of trick-or-treating that year.</p>

<h2 id="the-bath-that-makes-you-feel-like-two-million-bucks">The Bath That Makes You Feel Like Two Million Bucks</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mike_tyson_-8192148535-1-1496802613422-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mike_Tyson_(8192148535).jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Mike Tyson might be recognized as much for his eccentric lifestyle as he is for his skills in the boxing ring. You&rsquo;ve probably already seen his tigers in <em>The Hangover</em>, but he&rsquo;s also made some other crazy purchases. For Christmas one year, he gave his first wife a $2 million bathtub made of gold. Oddly enough, it&rsquo;s not even the only bathtub on this list &ndash; keep clicking through!</p>

<h2 id="not-quite-the-love-boat">Not Quite The Love Boat</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/4929922701_7b91664fc8_b-1-1496802863129-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wezl/4929922701">Flickr</a></p>

<p>When Jessica Simpson bought her then-boyfriend Tony Romo a $100,000 motor boat, she was probably envisioning that their love would outlast the warranty on it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback apparently had other ideas, and dumped Simpson the day before her 29th birthday after two years of dating.</p>

<h2 id="every-baby-wants-to-bathe-in-diamonds">Every Baby Wants To Bathe In Diamonds</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kelly_rowland_11_2012-1496803001979-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kelly_Rowland_11,_2012.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>And you thought your kids were hard to shop for. For Beyonce&rsquo;s baby shower before she gave birth to Blue Ivy, her fellow Destiny&rsquo;s Child pal Kelly Rowland gifted the Carters a $5,200 pint-sized bathtub. Encrusted with 44,928 pink Swarovski crystals, they might need a second one for the twins on the way.</p>

<h2 id="rihanna-s-million-dollar-secret">Rihanna&rsquo;s Million-Dollar Secret</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15743383387_fe06333070_b-1-1496803182096-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128992077@N07/15743383387">Flickr</a></p>

<p>With the release of her newest album, <em>Anti</em>, Rihanna reportedly earned about $75 million in 2016 alone. With great power, of course, comes great responsibility: The star is rumored to spend $1 million per year just on her hair alone. With that kind of money, you might be able to buy literal diamonds in the sky.</p>

<h2 id="the-town-that-kim-basinger-built">The Town That Kim Basinger Built</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/211174338_a5972d7295_z-1-1496803313046-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alan-light/211174338">Flickr</a></p>

<p>Some celebrities buy mansions, castles, weird pets, or expensive jewelry. And then others, like Kim Basinger, decide to buy an entire town. She purchased most of the area of Braselton, Georgia, in 1989 for $20 million with the idea of turning it into a tourist attraction and film location. That tanked, however, and she was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1993.</p>
