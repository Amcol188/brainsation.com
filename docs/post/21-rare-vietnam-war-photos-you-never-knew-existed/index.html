<p>The Vietnam War remains to be one of the most controversial and deadliest in the world’s history especially the United States. The war lasted for 20 years and claimed approximately 3.5 million lives. It is estimated that about 60,000 of those who died were Americans who were fighting the Soviet Union. The cold war was based on the fact that the Soviet Union had to be stopped due to its political influence as well as the spread of its communism. In the war that altered the course of history, these rare photos were taken.</p>

<h2 id="gulf-of-tonkin">Gulf of Tonkin</h2>

<p>The alleged controversial Gulf of Tonkin pushed the United States into the Vietnam War. Years later, some claims emerged showing that the incident never occurred.

<h2 id="captured-on-camera-executing">Captured On Camera Executing</h2>

<h2 id="burst-of-joy">Burst of Joy</h2>

<p>Prisoners of war face dangers and sometimes imminent death. This is what lieutenant colonel Robert Stirm was facing when he was captured in Vietnam. However, in 1973, he was freed and the moments of joy were captured when his family met him for the first time in California.</p>

<h2 id="radio-broadcast">Radio Broadcast</h2>

<p>Radio broadcasts were the best mode of communication for American troops in Vietnam. They would stay in groups while listening to broadcasts for them to stay updated. An American journalist working for Associated Press Oliver Noonan captured such moments. He died in 1969 after the helicopter he was using was brought down.</p>

<h2 id="anti-war-images">Anti-War Images</h2>

<p>Anti-war images were also captured especially outside the Pentagon. Jan Rose Kasmir was captured facing the troops in 1967 when protests were ongoing. Marc Riboud captured the moments which later played the prominent role of changing American opinions against the Vietnam War.</p>

<h2 id="us-soldier-protecting-women-and-children">US soldier protecting women and children</h2>

<p>This is probably the most memorable photo of the Vietnam War for American soldiers. The soldier was caught on camera offering protection to a Viet woman and her children near a river. It shows that even during the times of war, humanity remains a vital virtue.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vietnam2_2900854b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
