<p>With the 2018 Olympics upon us, you might find yourself flipping through photos of hot female athletes &ndash; so, we&rsquo;ve saved you some trouble. While all athletes are in shape (it&rsquo;s kind of a requirement of the job) some of them are just downright sexy. For many of them, time off from training means there&rsquo;s plenty of time to model, and plenty of these ladies do just that. You may recognize a number of these sexy athletes from their various ads and photoshoots in which they aren&rsquo;t at all shy about showing off their incredible bodies. Check out 20 of the hottest Olympians to ever compete in the Games.</p>

<h2 id="ellen-hoog-netherlands">Ellen Hoog, Netherlands</h2>

Maddie isn&rsquo;t just a talented athlete &ndash; she&rsquo;s the whole package, beauty and brains, as they say.

She has earned a spot on England’s Commonwealth Games squad and will be heading to Australia to compete this coming April. Her Instagram page is filled with hot photos.</p>

<h2 id="michelle-jenneke-australia">Michelle Jenneke, Australia</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19_opt-1515553129199.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXNcxbIHfLx/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=mjenneke93">Instagram/Michelle Jenneke</a> A quick Google search of Michelle Jenneke will kick back a result that describes her as an &ldquo;Australian model&rdquo; &ndash; which she is. But she is also a runner. The 24-year-old was in Rio for the 2016 Summer Games. And, last but not least, we meet a stunning brunette who is part of Russia&rsquo;s curling team.</p>

<h2 id="anna-sidorova-russia">Anna Sidorova, Russia</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20_opt-1515553416833.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW8QBbOgCdg/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=curlme_anna">Instagram/Anna Sidorova</a> Curling is some kind of phenomenon that takes the world by storm every time the Winter Olympics roll around. Russia&rsquo;s Anna Sidorova is also a phenomenon that people can&rsquo;t seem to get enough of. Maybe you can&rsquo;t see her hot bod under all of her winter clothes, but we&rsquo;re here to assure you that Sidorova is on fire.</p>
