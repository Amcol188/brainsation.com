<p>There are a lot of reports painting Trump as an entertaining president full of himself. Such news however valid they may be should also focus on the president&rsquo;s achievements. It is indisputable that the Trump administration achieved some of its promises within the first 100 days in office.</p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4abab4b9-4c70-4344-b559-69758efdd8c2.jpg"><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4abab4b9-4c70-4344-b559-69758efdd8c2-300x153.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="1-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-justice"><strong>1. Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court Justice</strong></h2>

<p>Against all the odds, Trump managed not only to nominate but also confirm Neil Gorsuch as the Supreme Court Justice. It was not a bed of roses; the Democrats fought back provoking the change of procedural rules for the confirmation vote to be decided.</p>

<h2 id="2-regulation-laws"><strong>2. Regulation Laws</strong></h2>

<p>Faithful to his campaign promises, Trump has made it possible to eradicate wasteful and unnecessary laws. In his proposal of killing two regulations to introduce a new one, the president hopes to remove procedural laws that hinder businesses. It is a wait and sees for if this promotes business creating jobs.</p>

<h2 id="3-trans-pacific-partnership"><strong>3. Trans-Pacific Partnership</strong></h2>

<p>It will be remembered that in Trump administration, the United States successfully withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Moreover, the president succeeded in ensuring that the Carrier Furnace Manufacturing industry remains in Indiana other than being relocated to Mexico saving jobs.</p>

<h2 id="4-obama-era-gun-control"><strong>4. Obama-era Gun Control</strong></h2>

<p>Although this is a controversial debate, Trump administration has managed to nullify the Obama regulation that required sharing of information of persons benefiting from Disability Insurance. This would imply that when these persons wanted to buy guns, their background checks would show up. Trump nullified it arguing that the second amendment rights would be endangered for law-abiding citizens.</p>

<h2 id="5-white-house-lobbying"><strong>5. White House Lobbying</strong></h2>

<p>Making good on his campaign vows to have a lifetime ban in place for white house officials fond lobbying for foreign governments, Trump has made it happen. The ban affects executive branch with room for restriction waiver by the president.</p>

<h2 id="6-economic-confidence"><strong>6. Economic Confidence</strong></h2>

<p>The current consumer confidence in the United States is at the highest for the last 17 years. So far, more than 500,000 jobs have been created. The stock market has also risen like never before, 2nd biggest to one experienced when J.F Kennedy was the president.</p>

<h2 id="7-pro-life-surge"><strong>7.    Pro-Life Surge </strong></h2>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s Pro-Life surge was seen as a joke by many. In fact, the conservatives were cynical about it. Trump has proven otherwise by repealing the Obama requirement that made states sponsor and fund Planned Parenthood. Instead, his administration reintroduced the Mexican City Policy that prevents tax money from funding NGOs promoting abortion saving millions of children.</p>

<h2 id="8-cut-funds-to-sanctuary-cities"><strong>8. Cut funds to sanctuary cities</strong></h2>

<p>In some American cities, illegal people would break the law with impunity because of the notion of living under the rule of law. Through a liberal judge, Trump administration has protected citizens from violence and murder.</p>

<h2 id="9-smart-foreign-policy-actions"><strong>9.    Smart Foreign Policy Actions</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has wrung business concessions with China. Also, he has also managed to convince China to work with the United States in dealing with North Korea crisis.  Trump’s move in fighting ISIS has rejuvenated the war against terrorism worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="10-keystone-dakota-access-pipelines"><strong>10. Keystone &amp; Dakota Access Pipelines</strong></h2>

<p>The price of gas is expected to reduce since trump approved the keystone Dakota access pipelines. The move will not only create over 25,000 jobs but will also end the environmental Luddites holding the American people hostage.</p>

<h2 id="11-reduced-illegal-immigration"><strong>11. Reduced Illegal Immigration</strong></h2>

<p>Currently, the illegal immigration in the United States has fallen by about 72% thanks to the Tramp administration. The bold move to increase the number of ICE agents and to stop the illegal immigration advocacy program has started bearing fruits.</p>

<h2 id="12-reduced-unemployment-rate"><strong>12. Reduced Unemployment Rate</strong></h2>

<p>The rate of unemployment in the United States hit its low of 4.4% in May 2017. This could as a result of consumer confidence and various legislative moves made by the Trump administration. While critics will argue that the drop has been going on since 2010, it remains undisputed that more than half a million jobs have been created since Trump got into office.</p>

<p>In April 2017, the United States Treasury announced that it has approximately $182 billion surplus budget. This is the second highest surplus budget in American history. Others argue that it could be because the tax period was extended to April and not in March as usual.</p>

Such a high number of legislative passage was only noticed when Franklin Delano was the president and managed to sign 76 legislation in 3 months of office.</p>

<h2 id="16-100-million-grant-to-michigan"><strong>16. $100 million grant to Michigan</strong></h2>

<p>In April 2014, the state of Michigan experienced lead pollution which contaminated drinking water. More than 100,000 people were affected. However, in March 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency managed to award the state 100 million dollars to be used in upgrading the water infrastructure in Flint. This project was initiated by Obama but completed by Trump. It is only prudent that Trump having been achieved in his tenure.</p>

Currently, the two countries have achieved a lot in business and managing North Korea threat.</p>

<h2 id="19-removing-overblown-government-agencies"><strong>19. Removing Overblown Government Agencies</strong></h2>

<p>The Trump administration has managed to trim big government agencies with the aim of not only promoting small business growth but also to improve the agencies’ efficiency. This will see unnecessary organizations being removed enhancing accountability and effectiveness.</p>
