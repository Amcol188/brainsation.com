<p>Other than being the president, it is indisputable that Donald Trump is entertaining. Most people are divided between hating and loving him; some refer to him as a buffoon. In front of a camera, Trump makes an effort not to show his ego. This has been seen on various occasions from honoring fallen soldiers to his family meetings. The efforts sometimes don&rsquo;t just work! In some instances, he utters disgusting and offensive words against women.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/dumbtrump1main.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On October 17th, 2017, Trump took the media by surprise explaining how he had reached every family that lost a member in the military. Since then a survey has revealed that more than half of the families were never contacted. Emails also show that the white house officials were trying to cover it up.</p>

<h2 id="6-accusing-mexico-immigrants"><strong>6. Accusing Mexico immigrants</strong></h2>
