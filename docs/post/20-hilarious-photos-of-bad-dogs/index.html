<p>Humans and dogs share a special bond – a symbiotic one for that matter. Our furry friends not only provide us companionship, but they&rsquo;re also probably the most loyal pets we can own. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that every day is cuddles, rocking, and joy.</p>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Naughty-Dogs-13-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Naughty-Dogs-13.jpg">Seenox</a> It reaches a time when they get rebellious and engage in all manner trouble in the house. Sometimes we scold them. Other times we cannot help it but burst out laughing at their funny and stupid behavior. If you own a dog, you honestly can attest to this, and you most likely are from punishing your little friend. We&rsquo;ve gathered 20 funny photos of dogs caught in the act that will definitely get you cracking your ribs in laughter</p>

<h2 id="1-caught-in-the-act"><strong>1.Caught in the act</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/19iibf/oh_youre_home_early/" title="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/19iibf/oh_youre_home_early/">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/19iibf/oh_youre_home_early/</a>The dog and the cat caught in the act – in the kitty style position. He is as guilty as seen, and the look and those eyes say it all. Shocked to discover that mom is home early today. But then again, he must be cursing, and if it were possible, he would defend himself saying that it&rsquo;s not as it looks. ‘It’s just an innocent play, human!’</p>

<h2 id="2-am-so-sorry"><strong>2. Am so sorry</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://img.izifunny.com/pics/2013/20130318/640/izifunny-picdump-128-pics_10.jpg">IzFunny</a> Mommy enters the home, and the furry friend is glued to the staircase. From the look on his face, it looks like something is up, and he&rsquo;s unreservedly apologetic. The odds are high he must have spent the better part of the day in the bedroom. Either he&rsquo;s pooped and peed on the bed, or the beddings are on the floor.</p>

<h2 id="3-nothing-to-see-here"><strong>3. Nothing to see here</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dog-and-blinds.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokethabear.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/animals/dogs1/aw4tzergsd.jpg">PokeThaBear</a> That moment you enter the house, and you find your friend entangled herself to the curtain. His pulled, bitten it and tried all the tactics he could muster, but then stops the instance she sees you’re home. ‘Nothing to see here. I am just giving a hand with curtains.’ Stupid dog!</p>

<h2 id="4-everything-is-fine-here"><strong>4. Everything is fine here</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2281xq/nobody_knows_what_theyve_been_up_to/">http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2281xq/nobody_knows_what_theyve_been_up_to/</a> You just opened your living room door to find the two close friends, the dog, and the cat near the cupboard. Then you give out that look that suggests ‘Something fishy is going on here.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;re like, ‘What?&rsquo;</p>

<h2 id="5-two-are-better-than-one"><strong>5. Two are better than one?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15.jpg">BlogSpot</a> Truly, the owner must be cursing so hard. It must be really stressful to own the two dogs. And leaving the two together must have been a terrible idea. He opens the dog to find stuff torn into pieces and strewn all over. But they it’s like they’re retorting, ‘Nothing to see here, man!’ <strong>6. Baby&rsquo;s food is better</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/no-i-havent-seen-your-lipstick.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.viralnova.com/14-guilty-dogs/">ViralNova</a> He&rsquo;s eaten the baby&rsquo;s food. Besides, you&rsquo;ve warned and punished him a couple of times but doesn&rsquo;t seem to learn. Today, he gives that annoying look with food stuck all over his nose and mouth. There’s no denying he’s looking to get you more irritated and has nothing to apologize for.</p>

<h2 id="7-you-look-nice-in-that"><strong>7.You look nice in that</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheLibraryStore/status/701125447170420736">https://twitter.com/TheLibraryStore/status/701125447170420736</a> The dog is chilling on the street on a leash. He&rsquo;s got this huge love for the people that he has to remind them how lovely they look. The chances are high he&rsquo;s even kinda creepy and must have complimented a couple of women how awesome their bums look.</p>

<h2 id="8-let-me-join-you-partner"><strong>8. Let me join you partner</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/asdfgjklERI/status/701323888416788480">https://twitter.com/asdfgjklERI/status/701323888416788480</a> Dogs are obedient and just love to spend time with their owners. But at times they need more attention than we can offer. This dog must have felt ignored for quite some time as the owner watches some movies on Netflix and decided the best thing to do is to watch together holding hands.</p>

<h2 id="9-you-are-hired"><strong>9. You are hired</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1nze0i/my_friend_put_a_childs_neck_tie_on_his_derpy_dog/">https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1nze0i/my_friend_put_a_childs_neck_tie_on_his_derpy_dog/</a> Such a little cute furry friend! Today it&rsquo;s her turn to clad a tie. Now she&rsquo;s posing and asking how she looks. ‘The human must have seen how cute I am and so he&rsquo;s decided to take photos.&rsquo; That tie and her color - you&rsquo;ll agree she’s adorable.</p>

<h2 id="10-get-me-some-new-play-toys"><strong>10. Get me some new play toys</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/InswUxY">http://imgur.com/gallery/InswUxY</a> It’s evening, and you&rsquo;ve arrived home from work to find this. Your dog stuck and dragging the high stool all over.  He’s pulled forth and to the back and still nothing. Truly, he must have been regretting his choice of play toys. This stool is surely not one of them.</p>

<h2 id="11-lets-go-out-please"><strong>11. Lets go out please</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5be134417046c0db497689930d260166-funny-animal-pics-funny-animals.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looks like she&rsquo;s been indoors for too long and is dying to go out a least for a few minutes. The moment she hears mommy blurb something about going out, he&rsquo;s like, ‘Yes, I would love that. Please, please, don&rsquo;t change your mind.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 id="12-stop-pretending-how-busy-you-re-my-friend"><strong>12. Stop pretending how busy you’re, my friend</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cameron-adams_0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re in your bedroom sitting at the study table. As always, your friend is in the room, but it seems you&rsquo;re too busy nowadays to realize he&rsquo;s around. He&rsquo;s torn the tissue into pieces and strewn it on the carpet and is now on the bed and gives you that look, ‘Stop pretending how busy you’re, my friend.’</p>

<h2 id="13-am-on-diet"><strong>13. Am on diet</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The moment you bring your dog food, he goes muff, muff and then looks straight into your eyes wondering whatever your problem is. If only he could speak, he would say, ‘How many times do I have to tell you I don’t want this.’ Such a picky eater!</p>

<h2 id="14-man-how-i-wish-every-day-would-be-like-this"><strong>14.Man! How I wish every day would be like this</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCCDNpeFauu/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BCCDNpeFauu/</a> It&rsquo;s your day off work, and now you&rsquo;ve taken your pup out on an excursion. From the looks of things, he&rsquo;s having the best day of his life, and he cannot help it but smile wildly on the car seat. ‘Man! How I wish every day would be like this.’</p>

<h2 id="15-i-missed-this"><strong>15</strong>. <strong>I missed this</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/2TiC4KB">http://imgur.com/gallery/2TiC4KB</a> That evening when you’re back home and thought it wise to walk your two dogs. You’ve been too busy at work that it’s been a week since you walk. But here we’re now, in the wild ready to explore. The two pals have never been happier.</p>

<h2 id="16-this-bed-is-cozier-than-mine"><strong>16.This bed is cozier than mine</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/080709d201d9654284336857c4d2c7f2-funny-animal-pictures-pictures-of.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Funny what our dogs do when we’re not around. Mommy enters her bedroom to find the dog lying flat on his back on the bed. ‘This bed is cozier than mine!’ Then he gives you that surprising look, ‘And what the hell do you mean it’s not my bed?’</p>

<h2 id="17-i-wanna-know-my-real-mommy"><strong>17. I wanna know my real mommy</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5c6a04712da1737e9c97b44e7b1f800b-crazy-animals-animals-dog.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It must be one of those awkward moment when your furry friend learns that you’re not the real mom. She’s now crying out loud and you can see it from the face and the shape of the mouth. ‘I wanna know my real mommy.’</p>

<h2 id="18-won-t-you-even-give-me-time-to-yawn"><strong>18. Won’t you even give me time to yawn?’</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0d6fba54c423e722f9f3f9ec2fe3b365.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The sun has risen and it’s another good morning. But your dog seems to be really moody today. Whatever happened to him during the night, you have no idea. ‘Dude, you’re asking too many questions. Won’t you even give me time to yawn?’</p>

<h2 id="19-gotcha-you-look-at-that-stupid-giggle"><strong>19.Gotcha you! Look at that stupid giggle</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/8ed93c185969f2de010a055593665269-wink-wink-funny-dogs.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>You cannot count the number of times you&rsquo;ve cautioned Tommy not climb on the furniture. He&rsquo;s forgotten you&rsquo;re home today and has done what he&rsquo;s used to when you&rsquo;re not around. Today isn&rsquo;t his lucky day, and you&rsquo;re like, ‘Gotcha you! Look at that stupid giggle.</p>

<h2 id="20-what-do-i-tell-my-boss"><strong>20.What do I tell my boss?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/8f02ce8c2e936e8edaabeaabcb328421.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just woken up by a knock at the door. It the neighbors kid. 8.50am and you’re supposed to be in the office by 9.00am. You can recall you set the alarm clock before heading to bed. Once again, the dog unplug the alarm clock and you overslept. ‘What do I tell my boss?’ <a href="http://www.writeraccess.com/writer/21178/">JoAnn S</a></p>
