<p>Although the human body is incredibly resilient in terms of what it can endure, most people aren&rsquo;t very flexible. Mastering the art of contortion takes a lot of training and good, rubbery genes.  Many factors are taken into account when establishing personal flexibility: joint structure, ligaments, tendons, muscles, skin, tissue injury, fat (or adipose) tissue, body temperature, activity level, age and sex all influence an individual&rsquo;s range of motion about a joint. The following people all scored perfectly in each of these departments&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-2.29.35-AM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;re looking at a list of some of those best female contortionists, and we seriously cannot imagine how much goes into this.</p>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/001372acd6f3154c216b31.jpg" alt="Related image" /></p>

<p>A lot of hard work and dedication goes into practicing body contortion, but some of the people who have achieved recognition as the best performers alive were also born with a natural talent. Here are 20 insane pictures of the most flexible girls in the world.</p>

<h2 id="irina-kazakova-has-a-ton-of-instagram-followers">Irina Kazakova Has A Ton Of Instagram Followers</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20-1516056018150.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sunallure/?hl=en">Instagram/Sunallure</a> Irina Kazakova enjoys quite a following as she shares her incredible talents and stunts with her fans on Instagram. With over 160,000 followers, she&rsquo;s becoming known as one of the world&rsquo;s most flexible women. She&rsquo;s still performing her contortions as well as rhythmic gymnastics all over the world.</p>

<h2 id="pina-conti-is-an-og-contortionist">Pina Conti Is An OG Contortionist</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-1515875544325.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYSd5KJTvPs">YouTube/alexyurch</a> Although people have been practicing gymnastics for thousands of years, Pina is definitely one of the first to make a name for herself. She gained popularity in the 80s after appearing in an ad for pantyhose! She&rsquo;s definitely an inspiration for a lot of the girls on the list!</p>

<h2 id="pixie-le-knot-is-also-very-well-known">Pixie Le Knot Is Also Very Well Known</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-1515875480861.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9_PyZxLcgg">YouTube/Eskil Agency</a> Pixie Le Knot is another contortionist that&rsquo;s incredibly well-known and there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ve seen her work. She has used her amazing abilities to appear in commercials, and she even landed a role on an incredibly popular TV show! Do you think you know which one?</p>

<h2 id="she-was-even-in-game-of-thrones">She Was Even In &ldquo;Game Of Thrones&rdquo;</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4-1515873664429-1516221468229.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgozelx5NWc&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube/List of Strange</a> She played the small role of Kayla, a prostitute in the King Landing&rsquo;s brothel. She can be seen in two different episodes using her contortionist moves to seduce some of the cast members. She&rsquo;s not the only one on the list to find herself on a popular TV show!</p>

<h2 id="leilani-franco-does-stunts-while-performing">Leilani Franco Does Stunts While Performing</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-1515873705652.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx3RVs3RfXc&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube/Top Ten</a> As if moving your body in extreme ways isn&rsquo;t already amazing enough, Leilani Franco is able to perform other talents while twisting around her limbs. She can be seen smoking a cigarette in the photograph above! She also puts on other skits while she performs. This duo-talent is seen in some of the other girls here as well.</p>

<h2 id="elena-lev-is-known-for-incorporating-hoops">Elena Lev Is Known For Incorporating Hoops</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6-1515875380801.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSmV7z94Ai4">YouTube/CDSTW Lari</a> Elena Lev is a talented contortionist that is best known for incorporating hoops into her act. Not only is it incredible to see what the boundaries of the human body are, but she also uses the hoops to create a mesmerizing performance that&rsquo;s certainly unforgettable. She&rsquo;s currently performing in Vegas for Cirque du Soleil.</p>

<h2 id="jodie-hollis-tobin-is-only-14">Jodie Hollis-Tobin Is Only 14</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7-1515872550344.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Jodie Hollis-Tobin is an incredibly talented performer, and still just getting started at 14-years-old! Already you can see that she&rsquo;s able to do things with her body that most people only dream of. Who knows what incredible things she&rsquo;ll be capable of as she continues to push her body beyond its limits.</p>

<h2 id="angara-contortion-is-a-group-of-contortionists">Angara Contortion Is A Group Of Contortionists</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8-1515872572840.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Watching one contortionist twist their body is incredible enough, but the group known as Angara Contortion takes that to the next level! They&rsquo;re a group of gymnasts that perform synchronized contortion! They match each other&rsquo;s talents to perform a routine and their ability to remain in sync is incredible. They take things even further than just that!</p>

<h2 id="they-re-capable-of-some-pretty-crazy-stuff">They&rsquo;re Capable Of Some Pretty Crazy Stuff</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9-1515872597597.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Aside from just doing synchronized contortions, they also use each other&rsquo;s bodies to create incredible positions stacked on one another. Not only do they have to focus on keeping their own balance in check, but they also have to ensure everyone else is performing perfectly as well. Very impressive!</p>

<h2 id="iona-luvsandorj-is-effortless">Iona Luvsandorj Is Effortless</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10-1515872633038.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Some of us hurt our backs just reaching for something while laying in bed. Iona Luvsandorj is able to fold her body in half without showing a hint of pain. We don&rsquo;t know whether to admire Iona&rsquo;s work or say &ldquo;ouch&rdquo; just looking at the way she&rsquo;s rolled up!</p>

<h2 id="bonnie-morgan-uses-her-body-to-terrify">Bonnie Morgan Uses Her Body To Terrify!</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11-1515875328057.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VI3m8Pp7CU">YouTube/Paparazzi News</a> Bonnie Morgan is a contortionist and an actress who is known for her role in the films <em>The Ring Two</em>, its sequel <em>Rings</em>, various other horror films and pretty much any TV show that needs a one-off contortionist! While a lot of the performers on the list use their bodies in a beautiful way, Bonnie uses hers to scare audiences!</p>

<h2 id="sofie-dossi-is-another-contortionist-teen">Sofie Dossi Is Another Contortionist Teen</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12-1515872660089.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Sofie Dossi is another teen on the list who already has incredible talents. Like Leilani, she also incorporates other acts into her routine aside from just contorting her body. You can see here that she was able to feed herself an apple with her feet while all wrapped up! That&rsquo;s not all she&rsquo;s able to do!</p>

<h2 id="and-she-s-good-at-archery">And She&rsquo;s Good At Archery!</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/13-1515872694747.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> She can also use her feet to shoot an arrow all while performing incredible body contortion. Most of us wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to hit a target if we were given a bow and arrow to shoot using our arms. Sofie is able to do it all, with her feet, before she can even legally drive a car! Who knows what she&rsquo;ll be capable of in decades to come.</p>

<h2 id="olga-pikhienko-is-a-circus-performer">Olga Pikhienko Is A Circus Performer</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14-1515875277298.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://emmerrs.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/olga-pikhienko-is-my-inspiration/">Wordpress/Emmerrs</a> Olga Pikhienko is an incredible contortionist who is best known for her roles in Cirque du Soleil. She performs circus acts that don&rsquo;t even seem possible. She started at only five years old, and performed with her father for a number of years before starting with the cast of Cirque du Soleil in the 90s.</p>

<h2 id="nina-burri-does-contortion-with-grace">Nina Burri Does Contortion With Grace</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-1515872722255.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> What Nina Burri is able to do with her body is really beautiful. She has so much Grace when she performs that it doesn&rsquo;t even seem like it takes an effort for her. She was a dancer for most of her life and only started doing contortion in her 30s. That&rsquo;s a pretty incredible age to start doing something that requires so much flexibility!</p>

<h2 id="maria-popazov-uses-her-mouth-well">Maria Popazov Uses Her Mouth Well</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/16-1515872744429.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjT7bSdwUMg">YouTube/Got Talent Global</a> Maria Popazov is not only able to hold her body up by only her mouth, she&rsquo;s also able to twist it in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t think possible! I&rsquo;m not sure any of us would feel comfortable relying on our mouth for anything but chewing our food; what she does requires unimaginable strength and willpower.</p>

<h2 id="nokulunga-buthelezi-is-mesmerizing">Nokulunga Buthelezi Is Mesmerizing</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/17-1515873753255.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx3RVs3RfXc&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube/Top Ten</a> Nokulunga Buthelezi has said that she hasn&rsquo;t received any training in contortion; rather, this comes <em>naturally</em> to her! After her mother discovered her sleeping in a strange position one day, she decided to pursue contortionism and see what her body was capable of. She&rsquo;s earned herself a pretty interesting nickname, too.</p>

<h2 id="she-s-known-as-the-snake-woman">She&rsquo;s Known As The Snake Woman</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18-1515873777029.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx3RVs3RfXc&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube/Top Ten</a> She has earned the nickname &ldquo;Snake Woman,&rdquo; because the way she moves her body is very similar to the slinky movements of a snake! She also believes that she acquired this ability from &ldquo;snake genes&rdquo; that have been passed down through her family. She definitely has something special about her!</p>

<h2 id="christine-danton-might-never-stop-performing">Christine Danton Might Never Stop Performing!</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19-1515875229763.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.singinggallery.com.au/past%20events.htm">Singing Gallery</a> Christine Danton might be one of the most incredible performers on the list considering the age at which she still amazes audiences. She is 67 years young, and is still out there doing her act! She&rsquo;s been doing this for 50 years and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.</p>

<h2 id="zlata-is-known-as-the-world-s-greatest-contortionist">Zlata Is Known As The World&rsquo;s Greatest Contortionist</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-1516055976383.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx3RVs3RfXc&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube/Top Ten</a> What Zlata can do with her body is absolutely incredible and has earned wide acclaim as the world&rsquo;s best contortionist. While there isn&rsquo;t really a way to measure who is the best, Zlata clearly has some strong competition with the girls on the rest of the list, talented as she is.</p>
