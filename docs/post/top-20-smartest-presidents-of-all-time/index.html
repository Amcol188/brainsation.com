<p>In 2006 Dean Simonton, psychology professor at University of California at Davis, finished researching the &ldquo;intellectual brilliance&rdquo; of 42 U.S. presidents. Some presidents pre-dated modern IQ testing. So Simonton estimated their scores with personality traits referenced in their biographies that indicate an above-average level of intelligence ­‑‑ &ldquo;wise,&rdquo; &ldquo;inventive,&rdquo; &ldquo;artistic,&rdquo; &ldquo;curious,&rdquo; &ldquo;sophisticated,&rdquo; &ldquo;complicated,&rdquo; and &ldquo;insightful.” From that study, we compiled a list of the top 20 smartest presidents.  And where the current President (Donald Trump) ranks among them.</p>
