<p>Donald Trump and his family have been in the limelight since he ascended to the presidency, and mostly for the wrong reasons. This list brings to light some of the secrets of this family from a seemingly incestuous father-daughter relationship through the facts of a neglected daughter, to a son who spent an entire year partying.</p>

<h2 id="1-a-descendant-of-immigrants"><strong>1. A descendant of immigrants</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/donald-trump-immigration-claims-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/donald-trump-immigration-claims-2.jpg">WBDaily</a> From his campaign manifestos, you would think Trump’s family has been in America for the past four generations. However, files from the family tree reveal that his mother, MaryAnn Macleod was Scottish immigrant. His paternal grandfather also came from Germany. So, why does he have such negativity against fellow immigrants? Check secret #3.  </p>

<h2 id="2-trump-s-wealthy-lineage"><strong>2. Trump&rsquo;s wealthy lineage</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Occupy_Dems_Trump.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Occupy_Dems_Trump-1.jpg">Politifact</a> Donald Trump’s father, Fred Trump was a wealthy real estate mogul. He built apartments and barracks for the US Navy during WWII along the East coast. When Donald was of age and had nothing of his own, Fred sent his son away to Manhattan with a $1 million loan. Talk, of a self-made billionaire!  </p>

<h2 id="3-a-bloodline-of-racists"><strong>3. A bloodline of racists</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hqdefault-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/86gbVJV1p2M/hqdefault.jpg">YTimg</a> Controversy over racial discrimination has dotted Donald Trump’s life from his business ventures to political career. However, this seems to be more than a personal choice. His father, though a son of an immigrant and a husband to one, was a renowned racist who allegedly never rented his real estate to specific races.</p>

<h2 id="4-infidelity-broke-first-marriage"><strong>4. Infidelity broke first marriage</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/14328.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/14328-1.jpg">InsideEdition</a> Donald Trump’s first marriage was dissolved after his wife of 15 years, Ivan Zelnickova got tired of his roving eyes. A year later in 1993, he got married to the side chick, Marla Maples. Fortunately, Karma being what she is, the marriage did not last half a decade, but not before a baby showed up. Read on to find out about what happened to the baby.  </p>

<h2 id="5-trump-prefers-models-and-non-american-women"><strong>5. Trump prefers models and Non-American women</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/160310_gma_ross1_16x9_992.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/160310_gma_ross1_16x9_992-1.jpg">ABC</a> Donald Trump is exquisite in all his choices.  His first wife was a model and athlete, the second one an actress and the third and hopefully, the last one, Melanie, is, yeah, a model. Another sinister fact is that only the actress is an American.</p>

<h2 id="6-donald-has-eight-grandchildren"><strong>6. Donald has eight grandchildren</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/160504160857-03-donald-trump-0504-full-169.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/160504160857-03-donald-trump-0504-full-169-1.jpg">CNN</a> Donald Trump has five kids, three sons, Donald Jr, Eric and Barron and two daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany. He has eight grandchildren, five from Donald Jr and three from Ivanka. So there are other ways of keeping the family legacy!</p>

<h2 id="7-tiffany-trump-the-black-sheep"><strong>7. Tiffany Trump, the black sheep</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tdy_alexander_tiffany_trump_170126.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/tdy_alexander_tiffany_trump_170126.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg">NBC</a> Tiffany is the only kid Donald had with his second wife, Marla Maples. She stands out as the black sheep on his father’s list of blessings. He rarely refers to her as favorably as he does to Ivanka. But it is Donald Jr who ought to be the black sheep as unveiled in #8.</p>

<h2 id="8-donald-trump-jr-probably-not-a-real-trump"><strong>8. Donald Trump Jr, probably not a real Trump</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/download-1-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/e24e80d/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F45%2F16%2F9a8e360d4ee5828bbb539e926423%2Fdonald-trump-jr-ap.jpg">Politico</a> The 39-year-old Executive Vice President of the Trump organization is the oldest child of Mr. Trump. Even though he was born while Trump was married to Ivana, he is the only one among all the kids who do not have the classic blonde hair of the Trumps. Is there something only Ivana knows?</p>

<h2 id="9-father-romantically-attracted-to-daughter"><strong>9. Father romantically attracted to daughter</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Trump-Ivanka-Creepy-Cringe-Leave-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Trump-Ivanka-Creepy-Cringe-Leave-1-1.jpg">PressCDN</a> Trump once said that his daughter, Ivanka is so pretty he would not mind dating her if she was not her blood. He also repeatedly says she is her favorite kid. Is this a father’s love perfected or gone awry? And where does this leave Tiffany Trump? See next.</p>

<h2 id="10-no-security-details-for-tiffany-trump"><strong>10. No security details for Tiffany Trump</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/f566dd75605e23daf2e6cc7ef2b6c3f5-donald-trump-daughter-tiffany-girl-memes.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f5/66/dd/f566dd75605e23daf2e6cc7ef2b6c3f5--donald-trump-daughter-tiffany-girl-memes.jpg">PinIMG</a> While all young Trumps enjoy the security privileges of being the seed of the man running the World’s superpower, one Tiffany Trump is on her own. What raises eyebrows is that her mother too has her secret service personnel available on demand. But Tiffany is a co-author of her misfortune.</p>

<h2 id="11-wild-tiffany"><strong>11. Wild Tiffany</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2015_20Tiff_20Trump.0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4498927/2015_20Tiff_20Trump.0.png">VoxCDN</a> Tiffany has a wild party life which only her Instagram fans understand. It would require more secret service personnel to watch over this night owl than the President. But she is not the first of the Trumps to walk this path.</p>

<h2 id="12-donald-jr-partied-365-consecutive-days"><strong>12. Donald Jr partied 365 consecutive days</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maxresdefault-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Donald Jr took time off to party in Aspen, Colorado. Unlike Tiffany, he partied without working for the entire year.  He then bade partying goodbye for good. Unfortunately, there some crazy things only kids of billionaires do, like the next one.</p>

<h2 id="13-donald-jr-is-a-poacher"><strong>13. Donald Jr is a poacher</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hunt30n-8-web.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/pics-rump-adult-sons-hunting-game-africa-resurface-article-1.2308107">NYDAILYNEWS</a> Don admits that hunting kept him out of trouble while growing up. But it seems he never grew out of his habit. Don has turned into a trophy hunter, a name used to refer to wealthy poachers. He is partly responsible for the reduced number of endangered animals in the Zimbabwean Savannah where he has been several times.</p>

<h2 id="14-does-trump-hate-the-media"><strong>14. Does Trump hate the media?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/waponews.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/sites/insider.foxnews.com/files/styles/780/public/waponews.jpg?itok=XAIIyhB_">FoxNews</a> Donald Trump has always claimed that the media churns out fake news. His double-edged sword might have hurt the family of his third son, Eric Trump who is married to CBS News’ associate producer.  But Eric too has an ugly side which we dare explore in the next slide.</p>

<h2 id="15-a-heartless-eric"><strong>15. A heartless Eric</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/41593655.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://content.newsinc.com/jpg/3129/31219224/41593655.jpg?t=1470145440">NewsInc</a> Eric un-apologetically shammed female victims of rape and harassment claiming his sister cannot allow that to happen to her. Either he is a heartless son of a billionaire or training to take after his father’s pudenda-grabbing habits. Either way, Karma will do her thing. Hands crossed for Ivanka and Tiffany.</p>

<h2 id="16-ivanka-sold-lemons-to-the-chinese"><strong>16. Ivanka sold lemons to the Chinese</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/f4a716a2-e9a6-11e6-925a-a992a025ddf7_1280x720.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ivanka is as aggressive in business as her father to the last bit. She brushed shoulders with the Chinese for selling them highly flammable scarves. She also had to deal with a copyright infringement lawsuit on her shoe line.</p>

<h2 id="17-extremely-high-parental-expectations"><strong>17. Extremely high parental expectations</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1_123125_2135002_2180608_2203666_081107_fam_kidstn.gif.CROP_.original-original.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Slate Trump Sr. seems to handle his children the same way he handles his business employees. He reportedly has very high expectation of their athletic and academic performances. Anyway, how can you expect less from those you trust to take care of your lifetime achievement? Now that we have mentioned jobs it impossible to avoid the next one.</p>

<h2 id="18-donald-trump-jr-has-only-one-employment-history"><strong>18. Donald Trump Jr. has only one employment history</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/the-life-of-donald-trump-jr-who-once-lived-out-of-a-truck-didnt-speak-to-his-father-for-a-year-and-is-now-embroiled-in-a-russia-scandal.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/the-life-of-donald-trump-jr-who-once-lived-out-of-a-truck-didnt-speak-to-his-father-for-a-year-and-is-now-embroiled-in-a-russia-scandal-1.png">BusinessInsider</a> It is true that Don has never worked in any other company except his father’s. He possibly doesn’t know how to write a resume or prepare for a job interview. But he earns more than the experts.</p>

<h2 id="19-ivanka-helps-her-little-sister"><strong>19. Ivanka helps her little sister</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22-Tiffany-Ivanka-Trump.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.2x.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22-Tiffany-Ivanka-Trump.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.2x-1.jpg">NYMAG</a> Despite their father’s apparent prejudice, Ivanka and Tiffany are getting along just fine. At least that&rsquo;s all we know now. Ivanka reportedly helped Tiffany get an internship at Vogue.</p>

<h2 id="20-pampered-or-privileged"><strong>20. Pampered or privileged?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maxresdefault-1-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This final one takes a swing at the only baby on the block, Barron Trump. He reportedly has an entire floor to himself in their Manhattan home. The best question seems not to be what a ten-year-old needs an entire penthouse floor for but rather, how big is the floor? And the answer is profound; it is a secret only the Trumps know. <a href="http://www.writeraccess.com/writer/21686/">James F</a></p>
