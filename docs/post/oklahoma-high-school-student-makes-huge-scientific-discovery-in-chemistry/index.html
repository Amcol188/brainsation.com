							<p>When a professor used a recent scientific paper to challenge his chemistry students during one of his lectures, little did he know that one of them, would take up the challenge and create a new breakthrough in chemistry. From <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/chemistry/a-high-school-kid-from-oklahoma-just-made-a-massive-breakthrough-in-chemistry/">IFLScience</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dr-rahman-and-mr-wang-co-authors-of-the-new-paper-1024x771.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44254-high-school-student-george-wang-carbon-7-bonds">Inverse.com</a> High school chemistry tells us all about the versatility of carbon. You might recall that carbon is missing four electrons in its outer shell so it&rsquo;s looking to form up to four bonds. Having this ability makes it very useful as the basis for anything biological. These four bonds are found in so many important molecules, from DNA to alcohol to diamonds. But that’s not the whole story. There are exceptions, situations in which carbon can do more than four bonds. The element in those cases is nicknamed hypercarbon. In the 1950s, it was shown that carbon can sometimes form five bonds. And in 2016, a German team showed how to make a six-bond hypercarbon.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/carbon-bonds.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44254-high-school-student-george-wang-carbon-7-bonds">Inverse.com</a> This paper was the start of this discovery. Dr AK Fazlur Rahman was giving a lecture on carbon at Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics in Oklahoma City. He used the 2016 paper to challenge his students on thinking about the possibility of carbon with more than six bonds. Unexpectedly, one of his students, George Wang, did more than just imagine it. He showed that six was not a strict limit. It was possible to have a carbon with seven bonds. Upon reviewing Wang&rsquo;s calculations, Dr Rahman verified that it did, indeed, show a stable seven-bond configuration of carbon and hydrogen. You can read these calculations for yourself as they are now published in the Journal of Molecular Modeling. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00894-018-3640-9">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00894-018-3640-9</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/913134">PX Here</a> As for the construction of this bond, here&rsquo;s more from <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/chemistry/a-high-school-kid-from-oklahoma-just-made-a-massive-breakthrough-in-chemistry/">IFLScience</a>: <em>The team showed that it is possible to construct a pyramid shape made of carbon atoms. The base would be a hexagonal carbon ring and the vertex would connect with all six of these carbons. Since every carbon would also link to a hydrogen atom it ends up that the vertex carbon has seven bonds.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/62417144810344900/?lp=true"><em>Pinterest</em></a> <em>Molecules sporting hypercarbon atoms are extremely unusual compounds, so this could turn out to be revolutionary. Such structures could lead to a completely new approach to organic chemistry. Hydrogen storage is a potential application. New avenues for chemical synthesis are also possibilities mentioned in the paper.</em> George Wang has been accepted to Stanford University where he&rsquo;ll start taking college classes later on this fall. He hopes to major in Chemistry. Something tells us, he&rsquo;s going to do pretty well.</p>
