							<p>It seems everyday there&rsquo;s another story of paranormal phenomena entering the mainstream of science and thought. Recently, our Navy&rsquo;s encounter with the Tic Tac UFO that stalked on of our ships and was able to cloak itself into invisibility made the the rounds. This week, we get news that an Ivy League educated, mainstream psychiatrist has come forward to proclaim that demonic possession is real and that people seeking help should not be ignored.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St._Francis_Borgia_Helping_a_Dying_Impenitent_by_Goya.jpg">Painting by Goya - Wikimedia Commons</a> From <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-demonic-possession-real-victims-081531844.html">Yahoo News</a>: It is a phenomenon that is on the rise throughout the world: The number of cases of demonic possession - and demands for priests to carry out exorcisms - is, according to multiple sources, soaring. Medical science remains sceptical. However, a Princeton-and-Yale-educated mainstream psychiatrist believes demonic possession is indeed very real - and claims that the majority of Americans agree with him. With 25 years experience in a private psychiatric practice and as a professor at New York Medical College and Columbia University, Dr Richard Gallagher has a rare vantage point to observe human behavior. And then there is the inhuman.</p>

<p><a href="http://midnightinthedesert.com/richard-gallagher/">Midnight in the Desert</a> He is also a sought-after psychiatrist for discernment, the initial step in determining the need for exorcism. Dr Gallagher has evaluated hundreds of cases of possible possession and, in a wide-ranging and rare interview with the Telegraph, explains why he believes the phenomenon is genuine. In April, at a Vatican training course for exorcist priests, participants were told that demand for exorcism is booming as a result of a decline in Christian faith and the internet providing easy access to black magic, the occult and Satanism.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lel4nd/3731440027">Flickr</a> One of the incidents that helped cement his belief in demonic possession is the strange case of a woman he refers to as &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; a high priestess in a cult and direct worshipper of Satan. Again from Yahoo News: Julia revelled in her psychic ability and demonstrated her powers for Dr Gallagher. At 3am one morning, the Gallaghers’ normally placid cats went berserk fighting in the couple’s bedroom and had to be separated. Such behaviour had never happened before and has never happened since. Later that morning, Dr Gallagher was introduced to Julia for the first time. According to the psychiatrist: “The first thing out of her mouth was ‘So Dr Gallagher, how did you like the cats last night?’. I even have a letter from her to a priest that says ‘we raised a little hell in Dr Gallagher’s house last night’.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kmar/1223358107">Flickr</a> On another occasion, Julia demonstrated her ability at remote viewing. She told Dr Gallagher “we really hate Father &mdash;&mdash;-”, referring to a priest on the exorcism team. She explained that it was her job to “keep an eye on him” although she lived in a different part of the United States. Whereupon she described the priest at that moment “walking along a beach in his blue windbreaker and khaki pants and he’s saying prayers”. Dr Gallagher promptly called the priest on his mobile phone and confirmed everything that Julia had described. The priest noted that normally he would be in his rectory at that time but on that particular day had decided to say his breviary while walking on the beach. Ultimately, Julia refused to leave the cult and was not cured of her condition. “There are many other psychiatrists and mental health care professionals who do what I do - perhaps not to the scope that I do - who seem hesitant to speak out,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;That’s what gives my work some singularity. That I have had so much experience and that I am willing to speak out. I feel an obligation to speak out. I think that I should, Dr Gallagher said. Dr. Gallagher has a book from Harper Collins which will be coming out in the near future.</p>
