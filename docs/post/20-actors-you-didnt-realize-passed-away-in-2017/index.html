<p>Some people might not know that Sean Penn’s brother was also an actor. Indeed, Chris Penn turned up in movies as famous as _Reservoir Dogs_ – where he memorably played Nice Guy Eddie – and <em>Footloose</em>. However, both Penn’s career and his 2006 death from cardiomyopathy at the age of just 40 may have been somewhat overshadowed by his more famous sibling’s life and work.</p>

<p>British star Rob Knox may look familiar thanks to his turn as Marcus Belby in the movie adaptation of <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>. He was all set to appear in the franchise’s follow-up film as well but, heartbreakingly, was murdered while backing up his brother during a fracas in 2008. The young actor was only 18 years old.</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Lee Thompson Young had shaken off his Disney Channel past to shine as detective Barry Frost in TNT cop show <em>Rizzoli &amp; Isles</em>. Behind the scenes, though, Young was afflicted with depression and bipolar disorder – factors that may have contributed to him deciding to take his own life in 2013, aged only 29.</p>
