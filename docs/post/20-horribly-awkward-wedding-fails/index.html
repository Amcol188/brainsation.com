<p><a href="http://www.bridalhairart.com/2016/03/funny-and-sweet-wedding-photos.html">BridalHairArt</a> Weddings are meant to be beautiful. When we think of two people committing to love each other for the rest of our lives, our minds conjure pictures of white doves and perfumed flowers. Motivated brides spend months and small fortunes to plan and execute the perfect experience. Sometimes, however, good planning just isn’t enough. No matter how carefully an event is prepared, the unexpected can still happen. But that doesn’t have to ruin the big day! These 20 couples are proof that humor can lighten the burden of even the most awkward wedding fails.</p>

<h2 id="not-off-to-a-good-start">Not Off To a Good Start?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pic-dump-88-28-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/31-kickass-pics-for-the-weekend/84661107/">ebaumsworld</a> I&rsquo;m a little worried about this marriage.  If she can&rsquo;t stand his kisses on day 1, what&rsquo;s going to happen in 20 years?  The guy in the background seems to be getting a kick out of this.  How embarrassing to be that guy.  How do you recover from this?</p>

<h2 id="whose-idea-was-this">Whose Idea Was This?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/21-lifebuzz-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.citynews.al/2015/07/foto-44-fotot-me-te-cmendura-te-dites-se-marteses/1">citynews</a> She probably had visions of floating to the water’s surface like a newlywed swan. Instead, this cannonballing bride looks less than graceful as she falls in a shower of fuchsia flowers. The expression on her face lacks the blissful joy expected from a blushing bride on her wedding day. Oh well. There’s always Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="butts-maids">&lsquo;Butts&rsquo;Maids</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.catdumb.com/new-trend/">catdumb</a> Classy group right here!  This is shaping up to be one wild and crazy reception, if this is how they are during the day.  That is one wedding I wouldn&rsquo;t mind crashing.</p>

<h2 id="did-she-run-out-of-fabric">Did She Run Out of Fabric?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brides-you-cant-unsee.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://notablelife.com/29-cringe-worthy-wedding-dresses-you-wont-believe-exist/">notablelife</a> This dress was for a lady with A cups, not DD.  But flaunt it if you got it&hellip;I guess.  I bet her family is so proud of her on her very special day.</p>

<h2 id="a-timely-gust-of-wind">A Timely Gust of Wind</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/images.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The photographer got a little extra today.  But also, why are they walking in the middle of the road on a bridge with cars coming at them?  That car is literally going to run them over!</p>

<h2 id="is-she-going-to-carry-him-down-the-runway">Is She Going To Carry Him Down The Runway?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wedding-fails.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I honestly think that she could eat him whole.  I am always interested in knowing how these type of relationships came about.  Maybe opposites to attract?</p>

<h2 id="don-t-blow-this-picture">Don&rsquo;t Blow This Picture</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/periergigamoi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well this seems like a fun wedding.</p>

<h2 id="excuse-me-ladies-this-is-a-church">Excuse Me Ladies&hellip;This Is A Church!</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/106.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have not idea what is going on here, but it seems like there are too many people around for these kinds of shenanigans.</p>

<h2 id="dad-would-be-so-proud">Dad Would Be So Proud</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kozhnye-zabolevanija-foto-simptomy-lechenie-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Can you imagine if this was your daughter?</p>

<h2 id="gone-with-the-wind">Gone with the Wind</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18-acid-cow-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This gorgeous seaside celebration was briefly interrupted by a groomsman falling off the dock. Did the wind or the romance of the moment sweep him off his feet? Like the joyfully oblivious couple in the shot, we may never know. Maybe this overenthusiastic friend sacrificed his dry clothing to give the groom a one-of-a-kind gift.</p>

<h2 id="nobody-likes-a-show-off">Nobody Likes a Show-Off</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the wedding photographer told this guy to “have fun”, he may have taken him a little too seriously. That high jump looks like it was headed straight for that bridesmaid’s face. Only her cat-like reflexes protected her from the blow. As punishment for his miscalculations, he had to spend the rest of the reception with a huge split in the seam of his trousers.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-still-cake">There’s Still Cake…</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1265689870_bleeding.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>No bad feelings seemed to be held after this bride and groom had a small mishap during the cake cutting ceremony. The bride is still able to smile through the pain of a bloody nose, which she seems to have recently cracked against her husband’s bearded chin. The bright side? The cake was delicious!</p>

<h2 id="whose-idea-was-this-1">Whose Idea Was This?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/21-lifebuzz-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>She probably had visions of floating to the water’s surface like a newlywed swan. Instead, this cannonballing bride looks less than graceful as she falls in a shower of fuchsia flowers. The expression on her face lacks the blissful joy expected from a blushing bride on her wedding day. Oh well. There’s always Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="planking-priest">Planking Priest</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/original-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Planking was a photo challenge that took over social media outlets in 2008. Participants would pose flat on their bellies with straight arms and legs, like a corpse, in bizarre settings. This priest decided to show his support for this trendy young couple by photobombing their post-nuptial pics with this hilarious planking move.</p>

<h2 id="girls-just-want-to-have-fun">Girls Just Want to Have Fun</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BLpCFZfCAAAhHXx.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Parties are supposed to be fun, right? These ladies may have had a little too much fun. The open bar served as the inspiration for this flattering photo. An important point of etiquette to remember: wedding receptions are not nightclubs!</p>

<h2 id="always-pay-for-the-private-location">Always Pay for the Private Location</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7-brit.co-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An oceanside wedding is much more affordable when held at a public beach. However, that leaves you vulnerable to the impulsive whims of passersby. Unless one of this couple’s friends decided to strip down halfway through the photo session, this is a prime example of why it’s worth it to spend a little more on your venue.</p>

<h2 id="the-leader-of-the-pack">The Leader of the Pack</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8-acidcow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This precocious pooch wanted to make sure the bride knew her place from the first day. Even funnier, the groom seems to watch with detached amusement as the doggo relieves himself on the bride’s gown. The future may not be so bright for this canine-loving couple.</p>

<h2 id="the-bird-is-the-word">The Bird is the Word</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8-to-mati.gr_.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Releasing live birds at your ceremony can cost a small fortune. Birds are available at your local grocery store for less than $2 per pound! All it takes is a little elbow grease to create a budget DIY bird release.</p>

<h2 id="final-touches">Final Touches</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20-izismile-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s a good reason why the groom isn’t supposed to see the bride before the ceremony. Every little detail of her hair, makeup, and dress need to be perfect before he can lay his eyes on his personal goddess. This bride, with the help of a friend, tended to those final touches while calming her pre-ceremony jitters with a glass of red wine.</p>

<h2 id="opa-indeed">Opa Indeed</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Greek weddings are known for their exuberant dancing. This wedding party seems to have gotten carried away with the merry-making. This reveler might need to sit out the next song to clear his aching head after crushing his cervical spine on the ceiling.</p>

<h2 id="i-saw-a-spider">I Saw a Spider…</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-2-20.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The shocked look on this bride’s face means trouble for somebody. Her gorgeous veil and train are ruined by the clumsy-footed relative behind her. The smothered looks of amusement from the audience highlight the unexpected nature of the moment. Hopefully, the footprints on her gown didn’t ruin her wedding photos.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-capacity">Maximum Capacity</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2b7cf5c0cda7566750080856f09c817d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The best part about this photo is that, through all the chaos, the photographer kept shooting! Let this picture serve as a cautionary tale for all couples who think the rustic beauty of an old wooden bridge would make the perfect backdrop for their wedding party shoot: check the weight limit before moving everyone out onto the platform.</p>

<h2 id="king-and-queen-of-construction-sites">King and Queen of Construction Sites</h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10_45_30_197_file.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Who says glamour can’t be functional? After reciting their vows, this couple got right to work, literally building a future together. Even the backhoe is festively dressed for the occasion. There’s nothing wrong with a mutual love of heavy machinery. Just try to make the couch match the color scheme a bit more next time.</p>

<h2 id="marking-her-territory">Marking Her Territory</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Funny_wedding_pict_3547385k.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bride seems less than enthused by her husband’s pink surprise. Maybe those tight undies would have been better received in the privacy of their honeymoon suite. While the bride hides her eyes in emotional anguish, the older couple next to them seems to be thoroughly enjoying the entire spectacle.</p>

<h2 id="b-y-o-b-buy-your-own-burgers">B.Y.O.B. (Buy Your Own Burgers)</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/c10faeebf2756fab054b1a33a7621897.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Why does everyone expect to get a free meal at wedding receptions? In this economy, newly-established couples often have a hard time feeding themselves. This basketball-loving bride came up with the perfect solution to her wedding budget woes with this simple yet effective venue selection.</p>

<h2 id="torrential-flows">Torrential Flows</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-shot-2013-10-08-at-9.11.01-AM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sadly, what this young groom thought would be a chic gesture for his new wife turned into a hilarious fail. The expression of shocked dismay on both of their faces speaks volumes about their lack of champagne-opening experience. The bride looks like she is ready to bolt for the exit to escape the fabric-staining flows of liquor.</p>

<h2 id="i-m-not-even-wearing-heels">I’m Not Even Wearing Heels</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/svadba-0028.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every woman dreams of being the center of attention her wedding day. This statuesque bride didn’t have a choice. She towers over her bridesmaids like a giant from the olden times. Her unusual height only serves to highlight the look of newly-wedded bliss on her face. Wrong Side Buddy!</p>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/YgJhF0i-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>“I swear it was an honest mistake! She’s your sister. She looks just like you!” The excuses this guy came up with must have been gold. What made him think this was a smart idea?</p>

<h2 id="the-perfect-end-to-the-perfect-day">The Perfect End to the Perfect Day</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/17-lifebuzz-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some women want to be lavished in luxury on their special day. Others just want some solitude and a bottle of vodka to help them absorb the joy of their momentous occasion. Everybody’s different. This bride has her gloves and boots ready, so she can get right back to her garden after the festivities. <a href="http://www.writeraccess.com/writer/19550/">Laquiza G</a></p>
