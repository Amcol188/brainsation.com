<p><a href="https://manvsmanvsfood.tumblr.com/post/107540222058/season-3-san-diego">Tumblr</a></p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t crazy to believe Adam Richman weighed so much at one point.  He was the host of the show &lsquo;Man Vs. Food&rsquo; where he traveled around the country eating some of the most unhealthy foods you can possibly find.  He reached some seriously unhealthy weights during that time.</p>

<p><a href="http://starcasm.net/archives/172653">Starcasm</a></p>

<p>Christina Aguilera, who was a teen heartthrob, gained some serious weight after having children.  It wasn&rsquo;t entirely her fault and the criticism she got from the media was unfair.  However, she didn&rsquo;t like her appearance either and decided to get back in shape.</p>

<h2 id="christina-aguilera-now">Christina Aguilera - Now</h2>

<p><a href="http://americancolumn.com/from-lame-to-fame-amazing-celebrity-transformations-thatll-make-you-double-take/20"><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/christina-aguilera-golden-globes-2010-208x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
