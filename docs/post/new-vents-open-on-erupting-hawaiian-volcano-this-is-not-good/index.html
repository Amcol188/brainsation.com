							<p>Living conditions have not gotten any better for folks living on the big island of Hawaii. Between the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have taken place in the past few days, many evacuated residents are wondering when and if they&rsquo;ll ever be able to return home.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kilauea-volcano2-1024x682.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.maxpixel.net/Volcano-Outdoors-National-Park-Hawaii-Kilauea-3088675">Max Pixel</a> On Friday the Island was rocked by an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, the largest quake recorded their in more than 40 years, and the rumbling continued into Saturday as the U.S. Geological Survey recorded more than 477 quakes in a 24 hour period. The earthquakes have subsided for now, but residents there are still dealing with the Kilauea volcano which began spewing lava and toxic gas into the air on Thursday. From <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-volcano-eruption-spews-lava-high-in-air-into-leilani-estates-2018-05-04-live-updates/">CBS News</a>: <em>After a week of earthquakes and warnings, the eruption that began Thursday threw lava into the sky from a crack in a road and sent another line of molten rock snaking through a forest. The activity continued Friday, with reports of lava spurting from volcanic vents on two streets. Areas downhill from the vents were at risk of being covered up.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.maxpixel.net/Volcano-Outdoors-National-Park-Hawaii-Kilauea-3088675"><em>Max Pixel</em></a> <em>The community of Leilani Estates near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island appeared to be in the greatest danger. Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subdivision directly to the east. But scientists said new vents could form, and it was impossible to know where.</em> As of this morning, officials are reporting that 2 new vents opened in the neighborhood, bringing the total number to 10, and residents are wondering when they&rsquo;ll be able to return home. Also from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-kilauea-volcano-eruption-homes-destroyed-lava-volcanic-activity-today-2018-05-06/">CBS</a>: <em>&ldquo;I have no idea how soon we can get back,&rdquo; said Todd Corrigan, who left his home in Leilani Estates with his wife on Friday as lava burst through the ground three or four blocks from their home. They spent the night on the beach in their car and began looking for a vacation rental.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.maxpixel.net/Volcano-Outdoors-National-Park-Hawaii-Kilauea-3088675">Max Pixel</a> And&hellip; <em>Scientists said Kilauea was likely to release more lava through additional vents, but they were unable to predict exactly where. Talmadge Magno, administrator for Hawaii County Civil Defense, told CBS News correspondent Carter Evans that it&rsquo;s not known for how long the volcanic activity will continue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sad part about it,&rdquo; Magno told Evans. &ldquo;It could be happening for a long time, or on the other hand, like I said, mysteriously it could just end.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/slworking/4191800237">Flickr - slworking</a> Kilauea is one of the world&rsquo;s most active volcanoes and has been continuously erupting since 1983. In 1924, it erupted spewing ash and rocks weighing as much as 10 tons into the sky, killing one person. Then in 1955, lava from the volcano flowed all the way to the ocean. <em>In 2014, lava burned a house and smothered a cemetery as it approached Pahoa, the town closest to Leilani Estates. But this flow stalled just before it reached Pahoa&rsquo;s main road. Nearly 30 years ago, lava slowly covered an entire town, Kalapana, over the period of about a year.</em> For the sake of the island&rsquo;s residents, let&rsquo;s hope this quiets down soon.</p>
