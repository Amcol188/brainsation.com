<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/70s-show-actress-lisa-robin-kelly-dies-age-43-article-1.1427921">NYDailyNews</a> Our obsession with celebrities is a phenomenon as old as the moving picture. For some reason, a switch flips in our brains when we see someone on a screen that makes us want to know everything possible about that person and what they&rsquo;re doing <em>every single day</em>. But the pressure of constantly being in the public eye can have an adverse effect on celebrities, most of whom are just regular people trying to live normal lives when they&rsquo;re off-set. Some stars turn to drugs and alcohol to deal with those pressures. Living the life of luxury isn&rsquo;t as glamorous as many of us realize. Here are a few of the celebrities who let drugs and alcohol have an adverse effect on their careers, and even their lives.</p>

<h2 id="the-tale-of-corey-feldman">The Tale Of Corey Feldman</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-coreyfeldman-1515716223099.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Feldman">Wikimedia Commons</a> In the 1980s, Corey Feldman was one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Everywhere you turned in the teen to pre-teen market, he was there. He was the guy. But he slowly slipped into drug addiction and all hopes for a successful adult career vanished. One of Feldman&rsquo;s <em>Stand By Me</em> co-stars suffered a far worse fate.</p>

<h2 id="floating-on-the-river-phoenix">Floating On The River Phoenix</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-riverphoenix-1515716620364.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix">Wikimedia Commons</a> By the 1990s, everyone knew the name River Phoenix. The young actor seemed destined to be one the of greatest actors in Hollywood history. No one knew anything about his private life until he was found dead in his apartment 1993. It appears he was mixing cocaine and morphine with his alcoholic habits.</p>

<h2 id="amanda-bynes-binds">Amanda Bynes&rsquo; Binds</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-amandabynes-1515722355751.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/8605258@N03/2109870004">Flickr</a> Nickelodeon child-star Amanda Bynes was said to have the &ldquo;it&rdquo; factor. However, she became plagued by psychological problems about her body image. She would later spend millions self-medicating with various drugs and was arrested for driving under the influence. She decided to take an indefinite hiatus from entertainment in 2010.</p>

<h2 id="the-other-other-baldwin-brother">The Other, Other Baldwin Brother</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4-danielbaldwin-1515715934504.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Baldwin">Wikipedia</a> There was a time when the Baldwin brothers were Hollywood royalty. Daniel Baldwin is the obscure one, but there was a time he was expected to rise above his brother Alec. A cocaine binge followed by a nude sprint through a hotel sprinkled with some grand theft auto changed all of that.</p>

<h2 id="whitney-houston-we-have-a-problem">Whitney Houston, We Have A Problem</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-whitneyhouston-1515719014143.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/American_pop_star_Whitney_Houston_dies_at_48">Wikimedia Commons</a> One of the top voices in music history, Whitney Houston was a powerful player. The singer&rsquo;s notable role in <em>The Bodyguard</em> blasted her to stardom. Fame got the best of the celebrity and she was known to abuse various substances, including cocaine. She was found deceased in 2012 and an autopsy revealed a mix of drugs in her system.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-charlie-sheen">What Happened, Charlie Sheen?</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6-charliesheen-1515715439829.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Charlie_Sheen">Wikimedia Commons</a> Charlie Sheen had one of the most storied careers in Hollywood history. The <em>Wall Street</em> star became the highest-paid actor on television in 2010, earning $1.8 million per episode of <em>Two and a Half Men</em>. Alcohol and cocaine forced him from the top and he recently revealed he is HIV-positive.</p>

<h2 id="the-legend-of-heath-ledger">The Legend Of Heath Ledger</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7-heathledger-1515721738382.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)">Wikimedia Commons</a> After coming off one of the most impressive performances as the Joker in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s <em>The Dark Knight</em>, Ledger was set to officially become legend. Before he could take the mantle, the actor was discovered dead with a cocktail of six different prescription medications in his system. Even actors who survive their addiction can end up resembling their former selves very little.</p>

<h2 id="gary-busey-as-played-by-gary-busey">Gary Busey As Played By Gary Busey</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8-garybusey-1515717271951.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooon2/1772451758">Flickr</a> There was a time when Gary Busey was known for, well &hellip; his acting. After a motorcycle accident speculated to have caused brain damage, Busey&rsquo;s demeanor drastically changed. In 1995, he suffered a cocaine overdose that left him out of the Hollywood limelight. He almost became a real-life caricature of his former self.</p>

<h2 id="macaulay-culkin-s-home-alone">Macaulay Culkin&rsquo;s Home Alone</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9-macaulayculkin-1515722634791.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Wikimedia Commons</a> He was on the verge of becoming the biggest child star of all time. <em>Home Alone</em> star Macaulay Culkin soared through his adolescence and into the hearts of fans worldwide. As he reached adulthood, drug and alcohol addiction took over and Culkin dropped out of the public sphere and has only appeared in a few independent films since.</p>

<h2 id="remembering-anna-nicole-smith">Remembering Anna Nicole Smith</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-annanicolesmith-1515723210601.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Anna_Nicole_Smith">Wikimedia Commons</a> Anna Nicole Smith was one of the most controversial figures of our time. She received public scrutiny for marrying a much much much older (but wealthy) man, allegedly for his money. The public pressure amounted to a dependency on multiple drugs. Unfortunately, her addiction won after she poisoned herself with multiple substances in 2009.</p>

<h2 id="a-prayer-for-richard-pryor">A Prayer For Richard Pryor</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11-richardpryor-1515716988114.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor">Wikimedia Commons</a> Every comedian will most likely list Richard Pryor as one of their top influences. Pryor paved the way for comedians to inject explicit and socially relevant material into their acts. However, freebasing cocaine led to Pryor drenching himself in alcohol and igniting his body in flames. He was never quite the same.</p>

<h2 id="judy-garland-literally-went-somewhere-over-the-rainbow">Judy Garland Literally Went Somewhere Over The Rainbow</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12-judygarland-1515718211173.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland">Wikimedia Commons</a> Judy Garland will be forever known as Dorothy from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The young actress&rsquo; career skyrocketed from that role. Her high demand led to intense production schedules. The stress introduced Garland to a reliance on prescription pills and she wound up overdosing on barbituates following a brief comeback.</p>

<h2 id="the-tragedy-of-philip-seymour-hoffman">The Tragedy Of Philip Seymour Hoffman</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/13-philipseymourhoffman-1515722140503.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangkuhnle/12294927796">Flickr</a> Philip Seymour Hoffman was arguably one of the best performers in Hollywood history. His diverse list of characters is unrivaled by most. He received numerous awards for his portrayal of Truman Capote, and won consistent praise throughout his career. But the recognition wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep Hoffman from relapsing into a drug-induced suicide. And he&rsquo;s not the only &ldquo;Hoff&rdquo; to struggle with addiction.</p>

<h2 id="drunken-david-hasselhoff">Drunken David Hasselhoff</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14-davidhasselhoff-1515719879504.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/evarinaldiphotography/6719086635">Flickr</a> David Hasselhoff may be one of the biggest stars in Germany, but he has mainly played himself for laughs stateside. Even though <em>Knight Rider</em> and <em>Baywatch</em> were big hits, The Hoff was well-known for his abuse of the bottle. Not many studios wanted to invest in such as high-risk actor on set after that.</p>

<h2 id="brittany-murphy-s-brief-tragic-struggle">Brittany Murphy&rsquo;s Brief, Tragic Struggle</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10-brittanymurphy-1515722951891.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Murphy">Wikimedia Commons</a> Brittany Murphy battled her way to the top of the A-list after being cast in <em>Clueless</em> and a poignant performance in <em>8 Mile</em>. Like many who find success too fast in Hollywood, Murphy battled with drug addiction. She was found dead in 2009 with multiple drugs discovered in her system.</p>

<h2 id="nicole-ritchie-s-reality">Nicole Ritchie&rsquo;s Reality</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/16-nicoleritchie-1515720858288.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/evarinaldiphotography/7270950706/">Flickr</a> Nicole Ritchie was comfortably riding the coattails of her famous father. She obtained her own reality show with fellow heiress Paris Hilton and things were looking up. Her success got the best of her when her addiction led to three arrests and five car accidents. Like the following celeb, her career was terminated.</p>

<h2 id="nick-stahl-s-judgement-day">Nick Stahl&rsquo;s Judgement Day</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/17-nickstahl-1515717936343.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeC-lGnajT0">YouTube</a> Nick Stahl was a rising star after landing roles in <em>The Thin RedLine</em>, _Carnivàle, _and <em>Terminator 3.</em> His substance abuse caused his marriage to crumble and his habits got the best of him. One incident led to an arrest for public indecency at an adult video store and Stahl&rsquo;s career has yet to rebound.</p>

<h2 id="reaching-lindsay-lohan-s-lowest-point">Reaching Lindsay Lohan&rsquo;s Lowest Point</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18-lindsaylohan-1515719244976.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ifiwere/Sandbox4">Wikimedia Commons</a> After a stunning rise to fame as a young starlet, Lindsay Lohan was bound to become one of the biggest names in Hollywood. As she got older, her public party life led to drug and alcohol binges and multiple stints in rehab. It is unlikely Lohan will be known for anything but her public meltdowns at this point.</p>

<h2 id="mourning-marilyn-monroe">Mourning Marilyn Monroe</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19-marilynmonroe-1515720571984.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe">Wikimedia Commons</a> Marilyn Monroe is one of the most iconic figures in entertainment history. The speed of the starlet&rsquo;s rise and fall led many to focus on the skeletons rumored to be piling up in her closet. The public pressure of fame got the best of the beauty and she was found dead from an overdose on barbiturates.</p>

<h2 id="chris-farley-goes-too-far">Chris Farley Goes Too Far</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20-chrisfarley-1515720173510.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/revjim5000/1510709794">Flickr</a> Chris Farley changed the entire landscape of physical comedy during his tenure on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and leveraged his popularity into an astounding feature film career. He was quite literally the biggest thing in comedy. Those close to Farley began to notice his problems with obesity and drugs. It eventually got the best of him and led to a tragic overdose.</p>
