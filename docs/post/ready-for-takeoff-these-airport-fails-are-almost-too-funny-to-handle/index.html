<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGKoTm7PpFw">youtube</a> Travelling is on many of our bucket lists. Whether you want to travel the globe or go cross-country, jumping on a plane is a convenient and relatively fast way to get anywhere you want to go. Navigating an airport may seem like a hike in itself. There are endless terminals and countless security measures — but even more astounding are the different people you get to see. The hectic, busy atmosphere of most airports sometimes has travelers acting rather silly. These hilarious airport fails will have you scratching your head — you won&rsquo;t be able to get through them without cracking up!</p>

<h2 id="travelling-gets-the-best-of-us">Travelling Gets The Best Of Us</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_exhausted-1515989306003.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/40/">Jetlaggin</a> Whether it is the long lines, looming delays, or the hurried masses — spending time at an airport is enough to have anyone dying for a nap. This woman represents all of us while traveling. She has simply had enough, and we can&rsquo;t blame her. That luggage definitely came in handy for an impromptu snooze.</p>

<h2 id="time-your-kisses-accordingly">Time Your Kisses Accordingly</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_kiss-1515978281936.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/14/">Jetlaggin</a> Be careful about your goodbyes at this airport — you may go over your time limit. Heightened security at airports — from baggage claim to customs — has become the main priority, and this now includes any smooching. It may seem frivolous, but PDA is risky business. Better be careful, those extra kisses may cost you!</p>

<h2 id="this-flight-attendant-was-caught-red-handed">This Flight Attendant Was Caught Red-Handed</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_poker-1515990149226.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/51/">Jetlaggin</a> Airport check-in lines can get super long really fast, but it looks like this flight attendant had plenty of time for a game of poker. Everyone deserves a little break from work now and again, but this person probably should have waited until everyone boarded before getting into a bit of gambling.</p>

<h2 id="snakes-on-a-plane">Snakes On A Plane</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_snake-1515974378180.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/80/">Jetlaggin</a> This is one way of scaring others away from your luggage. You have to give them credit for their slick sense of humor — but this joke can go badly if an innocent traveler doesn&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s a prank. The next photo will help you lighten up a bit, no matter how long your flight.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-always-5-o-clock-at-the-airport">It&rsquo;s Always 5 O&rsquo;Clock At The Airport</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_margarita-1515966829913.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1938fq/this_is_how_my_friends_dad_greeted_her_at_the/">@rhapsodyinpoo via Reddit</a> First impressions make all the difference. This guy decided to greet his traveling friend with a refreshment once he landed — and this would be hit for anyone who has been cramped on a plane for hours on end. This man is setting the bar high — literally — for anyone who wants to be picked up with a pick-me-up.</p>

<h2 id="this-symbolizes-how-we-all-feel-while-flying">This Symbolizes How We All Feel While Flying</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_done-1515991232525.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> We are always told not to step on or ride the baggage conveyor belt — but we&rsquo;ve all been tempted to do it. This looks like a super cozy ride and the way airports are set up we could all a little time off of our feet. Why is baggage claim always five hundred miles from the terminal? We need answers.</p>

<h2 id="going-through-security-is-always-a-trip">Going Through Security Is Always A Trip</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_speedo-1515991975973.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> You see everything going through the security line — and we mean <em>everything</em>. They say to remove your shoes and all jewelry, but this man might have gone a little too far. Nonetheless, he came prepared. The airport is a great place to sit down with a good read, and the next guy definitely had the right idea.</p>

<h2 id="it-must-have-been-a-slow-news-day">It Must Have Been A Slow News Day</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_papers-1515993050098.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://cavemancircus.com/2013/01/22/the-odd-sleeping-patterns-of-people-stranded-at-the-airport-35-pics/">Caveman Circus</a> This man is clearly living in the future and well-read on today&rsquo;s news. Why just read the newspaper when you can use it for a blanket or fort afterward? His idea is clearly genius, and his reward is some peaceful rest in one of the most hectic places on the planet.</p>

<h2 id="this-airport-nap-took-some-serious-innovation">This Airport Nap Took Some Serious Innovation</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_sleep-1515975984703.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/20/">Jetlaggin</a> Sleeping in an airport may seem almost impossible, but this woman has overcome this dilemma completely. Hopefully, everyone looks before sitting down — or this dreamy situation will quickly turn into a nightmare. Sometimes you have to think outside the box to make your time between flights bearable, and this lady nailed it.</p>

<h2 id="this-man-has-clearly-checked-out">This Man Has Clearly Checked Out</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_checkin-1515994258644.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://cavemancircus.com/2013/01/22/the-odd-sleeping-patterns-of-people-stranded-at-the-airport-35-pics/">Caveman Circus</a> This fellow chose quite possibly the worst place to take a quick snooze. The check-in counter is forever busy and the line is constantly moving — and this scenario definitely didn&rsquo;t go over well. He probably didn&rsquo;t think this one through. One thing that is for certain — this guy can sleep through anything.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-spot-this-star-wars-fan-from-a-mile-away">You Can Spot This Star Wars Fan From A Mile Away</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_vader-1515970228780.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6jmpkn/my_friends_daughter_just_flew_by_herself_for_the/">@eldy50 via Reddit</a> Who wants a bland welcoming committee when you could be greeted by Darth Vader himself? This dad did the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise justice — and I&rsquo;m sure his daughter will never forget it. I&rsquo;m sure this is the last thing any teen wants to see as she departs her plane, but she will definitely appreciate when she is older — <em>way</em> older.</p>

<h2 id="this-guy-is-pretty-in-pink">This Guy Is Pretty In Pink</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_pink-1515977162268.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/31/">Jetlaggin</a> Some people simply exude confidence — no matter what they wear. It&rsquo;s all about attitude, and this man knows he is rocking this pink ensemble. He definitely knows how to get attention. There&rsquo;s no missing this airport outfit. You haven&rsquo;t seen embarrassing until you view the next slide — yikes!</p>

<h2 id="from-welcome-home-to-tmi">From Welcome Home To TMI</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_sex-1515968311952.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/2dxv1OB">@jcsparkels via Imgur</a> Nothing like being cramped on a plane for a few hours to finding your ride humiliating you off of the tarmac. Putting your personal business out there — especially about your private parts — is probably not what anyone wants to come home to. There&rsquo;s never a dull moment in this family, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-keeping-it-old-school">Talk About Keeping It Old School</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_typewriter-1515994673315.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> This woman has settled the Mac versus PC debate for good. Why type on the newest laptop model when you can depend on something old and reliable? Whether she is writing her grocery list or a romantic novel, she looks pretty retro doing it. Typewriters are the way to get stuff done at the airport — no electrical outlet needed!</p>

<h2 id="security-s-biggest-nightmare-has-arrived">Security&rsquo;s Biggest Nightmare Has Arrived</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_metal-1515995302450.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> Airport security, you have been warned — this guy is about to set off all of the alarms. Whether it was complete coincidence or sarcastically intentional, this man deserves a medal — pun completely intended. The next slide is in the book how not to parent, and you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what this mom was thinking.</p>

<h2 id="this-mom-has-got-it-all-wrong">This Mom Has Got It All Wrong</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_baby-1515995963771.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> Motherhood is insanely stressful. Taking care of a tiny human is no easy feat, but this woman definitely needs to take a moment to rethink this decision. Letting a baby ride on the conveyor belt is a recipe for disaster — no matter which way you look at it. Hold on, baby!</p>

<h2 id="just-a-small-reminder">Just A Small Reminder</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_danger-1515997184864.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> Although this sign may point out the obvious, you can never be too careful. The illustration really sends the message in case someone doesn&rsquo;t feel like reading the entire warning. Keep your distance from those darn planes during takeoff! Looking for a way to get through the security line quicker? The next slide is a brilliant hack.</p>

<h2 id="that-s-one-way-to-get-through-security">That&rsquo;s One Way To Get Through Security</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_legs-1515997897807.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/hilarious-airport-photos/">KiwiReport</a> No one enjoys filing through the security line at an airport. It involves reorganizing all of your belongings and possibly taking off numerous layers of clothing — which can be time-consuming. This guy definitely cracked the code — just send yourself on the conveyor belt. Problem solved. Airport security may not be as thrilled.</p>

<h2 id="this-guy-is-definite-friend-goals">This Guy Is Definite Friend Goals</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_fam-1515971382699.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5k33qg/when_your_mate_says_hell_pick_you_up_from_the/">@smacktip via Reddit</a> How else would a pal pick you up from the airport on Christmas Eve? This man&rsquo;s Christmas get-up is anything but subtle, and it sure got these airport-goers in the holiday spirit. This friendship is the best present of all. We are head over heels for the next picture — and once you see it you will definitely understand why.</p>

<h2 id="always-aim-high-even-when-it-come-to-airport-antics">Always Aim High — Even When It Come To Airport Antics</h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airport_handstand-1515972435954.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jetlaggin.com/hilarious-airport-fails-just-in-time-for-summer-vacation/39/">Jetlaggin</a> Airport acrobats are sure to turn some heads. These two are obviously making the most of their delayed flights, and they even have an audience. Nothing like a little entertainment while you eat your overpriced airport food. An airport can be an extremely hectic place, but it&rsquo;s sometimes necessary to take a breather and do a handstand — no big deal.</p>
