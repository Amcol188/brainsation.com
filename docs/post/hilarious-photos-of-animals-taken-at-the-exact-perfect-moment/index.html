<p><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/627738/funny-animal-photos-perfectly-timed-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards#">DailyStar</a> Wild animals are majestic, fascinating, frightening and at times, downright hilarious. Animal photography is a labor of love that requires a lot of patience and it may take a great deal of time to capture that perfect moment. However, whether out of pure luck or preparedness, some talented wildlife photographers have successfully captured some perfectly timed animal photos. Most of these incredible shots of animals looking goofy are so unbelievable such that you would have missed the moment just by blinking. We rounded up some examples of the silliest animal antics ever captured on camera. We hope that you enjoy these chuckle-inducing photos.</p>

<h2 id="1-music-to-the-ears"><strong>1.    Music to the ears</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/3543.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e61cc6676b227dc35caf7a99f10cbe9cfe8a4e/0_0_3543_2362/master/3543.jpg?w=1010&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0cc89917eecf7172d837bc6582ece625">Guim</a> Who needs headphones when you have two musical birds to sing for you? This Impala appears to be enjoying a serenade from two oxpeckers – or perhaps a lullaby now that he looks a bit sleepy. The music must be really good and he can’t help but sing along.</p>

<h2 id="2-bye-bye-monday"><strong>2.    Bye bye Monday</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6000.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/dec/27/the-funniest-and-most-unusual-animal-photos-of-2016#img-5">TheGuardian</a></p>

<p>This is probably how I dive in my bed after enduring a tough Monday with all those long boring staff meetings while still nursing a hangover from a casual weekend of binge drinking with friends. What a better way to end a boring Monday that to dip your sorrows in bed?</p>

<h2 id="3-i-forgot-the-pizza"><strong>3.    I forgot the pizza</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4610F21500000578-0-image-a-97_1509962726498.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4610F21500000578-0-image-a-97_1509962726498.jpg">DailyMail</a></p>

<p>You get home late in the evening after a long day of work. It is a pizza night and your roommate was to order the pizza but there&rsquo;s no pizza in sight. You ask your roommate and he tells you he forgot to order the pizza and he has eaten the last cereals. “OMG,  you did what?!”</p>

<h2 id="4-a-headshot"><strong>4.    A Headshot</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5824dc3d1800002e00503660.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5824dc3d1800002e00503660.jpeg?ops=scalefit_600_noupscale">HuffingtonPost</a></p>

<p>If you think you are having a bad day, think again. This poor ox got literally shit on his head and that’s the price you get for generously offering free rides to people who have no etiquette. The unhappy face won’t help much though, what’s been done cannot be undone.</p>

<h2 id="5-smh"><strong>5.    SMH</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rodent.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rbk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/35/4000x2666/rodent.jpg?resize=980:*">HearStapps</a></p>

<p>The face you make when your friend says something so stupid in front of people and refuses to be corrected and you&rsquo;re forced to act like you don&rsquo;t know them. Most of us have that one friend who doesn&rsquo;t think much before they talk and they end up embarrassing themselves and all you can do is shake  your head and ask &ldquo;where did I find you?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="6-dancing-with-the-stars"><strong>6.    Dancing with the stars</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/funny-animal-pictures-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-25__880.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/funny-animal-pictures-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-25__880.jpg">BoredPanda</a></p>

<p>When you and your dancing partner are so in sync when dancing the Tango and you have incredible dancing floor chemistry and your focus is on making it to the finals of Dancing with the stars and winning the trophy – and maybe making a good couple one day.</p>

<h2 id="7-don-t-let-go"><strong>7.    Don’t let go</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/owlfalling.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rbk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/35/1600x1066/owlfalling.jpg?resize=980:*">HearStapps</a></p>

<p>That scary moment when you are falling off the bar stool after you&rsquo;ve had one too many and you&rsquo;re trying so hard to keep a grip.  Your clueless drinking buddies, on the other hand, cannot help you as they&rsquo;re lost in their own world and don&rsquo;t even realize that you&rsquo;re about to fall.</p>

<h2 id="8-cuteness-galore"><strong>8.    Cuteness galore</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4928.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/dec/27/the-funniest-and-most-unusual-animal-photos-of-2016#img-25">TheGuardian</a></p>

<p>A cute baby giraffe kissing his mother because everybody needs some affection - even animals. Mum’s kisses are the very special and the most sincere. When you&rsquo;re feeling low and need some cheering up, a mother&rsquo;s kiss has the power to cure it all. And there you are wiping off mummy&rsquo;s kisses, how ungrateful?!</p>

<h2 id="9-keep-your-eyes-open"><strong>9.    Keep your eyes open</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/47c1dc08fd8c6597360bcd64abb71b5a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is how you look when you’re struggling to stay awake and when you have to sit through an important but interminable lecture after a late-night and the coffee is just not cutting it. This owl knows the feeling too well.</p>

<h2 id="10-sneezing-bear"><strong>10.    Sneezing bear</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/50462b8b7789f73c7797297a2f399178.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bear was caught in the middle of a sneeze. &ldquo;Ah—Ah—Ah…Chooo!&rdquo; excuse the spit. The allergies are back, I&rsquo;ve got the sneezes and I don&rsquo;t have a tissue. I would appreciate so much if you could share some Kleenex.</p>

<h2 id="11-blep"><strong>11.    Blep </strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/buffalo-mouth.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand the fascination with girls sticking out their tongues in pictures on Instagram. Well, this cow has caught up with the trend and he’s taking it a notch higher or maybe he’s just a troll who’s used to ruining good shots. This reminds me of Miley Cyrus.</p>

<h2 id="12-oops"><strong>12.    Oops!</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pelican.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rbk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/35/2560x1706/pelican.jpg?resize=980:*">HearStapps</a></p>

<p>If you can imagine the feeling of dropping your dinner on the floor after hours of preparing it, you know how this pelican feels. The clumsy bird just dropped his hard-earned meal. The poor bird looks distraught as he probably ponders on how he’ll go back fishing. Hope he’ll be more careful next time.</p>

<h2 id="13-eew-that-s-disgusting"><strong>13.    Eew, that&rsquo;s disgusting</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/download.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This gorilla is captured as he brazenly picks his nose and like most humans, he shows no remorse and makes no attempt to disguise his disgusting habit. The gorilla seems unperturbed and he&rsquo;s so confident you&rsquo;d think that he&rsquo;s digging for gold. Shame to all those who dig for boogers in public.</p>

<h2 id="14-the-princess-s-kiss"><strong>14.    The princess&rsquo;s kiss</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/frog-chipmunk-843003.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interspecies friendships are unusual but possible.  You are likely to find interactions between animals of different species in the wild and the frog and the chipmunk are no different. The chipmunk may have just found her prince and is about to deliver the transforming kiss. Hope he’s the last one she kisses.</p>

<h2 id="15-get-off-of-me"><strong>15.    Get off of me!</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/249FEA7E00000578-0-image-a-14_1421079988858.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The hippopotamus seems infuriated as he tries to get the pesky birds off his back. The baby hippo is less amused with the oxpeckers who supposedly helps him get rid of parasites. You’d probably react in the same way if you had creepy spiders crawling up your back. A mere thought of it gives me the chills.</p>

<h2 id="16-yoga-master"><strong>16.    Yoga master</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/11/DSC_0810-1024x755.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you’ve mastered your yoga moves and you can roll your body round to form a furry ball and you’re so impressed with your new moves. You can get some inspiration from the squirrel’s moves. This squirrel was captured in an unusual position probably biting off parasites from it belly fur.</p>

<h2 id="17-excuse-me"><strong>17.    Excuse me </strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1mKxwry.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The expression on this cute primate is priceless. The lemur is oddly-humanlike and very rare to find, endemic to the Madagascan Island. This is a perfect expression when a rude waiter gets your order wrong and you say, “Excuse me, would you mind repeating loudly what you said under your breath?”</p>

<h2 id="18-protective-mother-bird-and-her-baby"><strong>18.    Protective mother bird and her baby</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/0003c9c1.jpeg" alt="" /> When you are watching a PG-rated movie with your kids and a horrible scene comes up and you realize it’s not what you expected. You feel guilty for ruining your kid&rsquo;s innocence and wish the scene can be unseen but it’s too late. “Baby! Don’t look! You definitely don’t want to see that!’’</p>

<h2 id="19-drunk-duck"><strong>19.    Drunk duck</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SKDcyZC.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The duck thought he had it all together but oops! When you feel so confident after drinking a whole keg of beer but you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re not drunk. You&rsquo;re walking back home but you just can&rsquo;t get your footing right as you stagger and you end up falling in the water puddle.</p>

<h2 id="20-speed-limit"><strong>20.    Speed limit</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/abe1d683369e32c4c57073e246a0d49d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For some reason, this cheetah looks bewildered by the speed limit post and he’s probably wondering “Are these people serious?!” How do they expect me to do 40 mph?!”</p>

<h2 id="21-just-chilling"><strong>21.    Just chilling</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meerkat_lounging_0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Meerkats are cooperative mammals who live in groups as they help each other keep guard and collect food. This meerkat seems to be really enjoying the summer while showing off his summer body. This cute animal is basking in the sun and probably watching the skies for birds of prey.   <a href="http://www.writeraccess.com/writer/21178/">JoAnn S</a></p>
