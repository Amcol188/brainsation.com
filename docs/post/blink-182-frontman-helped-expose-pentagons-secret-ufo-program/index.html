							<p>Music fans know Tom DeLonge as the frontman for the rock band Blink 182 but in the world of paranormal investigations, he&rsquo;s a rock star of a whole different kind. It seems that since he was a teenager, DeLonge has been obsessed with UFO&rsquo;s and the paranormal. In fact, when he got the money from his first big record contract, DeLonge used the funds to buy a computer so that he could research the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life. Heck, he&rsquo;s even co-written a 700 page novel about UFO&rsquo;s. His biggest feat, however, may be uncovering the Pentagon&rsquo;s secret UFO program.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tom-delonge.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.91x.com/adam/tom-delonge-releasing-non-fiction-book-detailing-ufo-findings/">91x.com</a> That was done largely in part to DeLonge&rsquo;s latest business venture, To The Stars Academy. From <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/ufos-are-suddenly-a-serious-news-story-you-can-thank-the-guy-from-blink-182-for-that-1.530224">Stars and Stripes</a>: At a launch event for To The Stars Academy in Seattle last fall, he explained that he was expanding his small entertainment venture — which has mostly published his graphic novels and books about UFOs and the paranormal — into a far more ambitious scientific operation, to explore &ldquo;the most controversial secret on Earth.&rdquo; For his advisory board, DeLonge recruited physicists, aerospace experts, and former Department of Defense officials. Remember the &ldquo;What the f&mdash; is that thing?&rdquo; video of a Navy pilot tracking a UFO that looked like a high speed Tic Tac? DeLonge and his group were behind the efforts to get that tape released to the public.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ufo-video.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Screen Grab One of the people on DeLonge&rsquo;s advisory board is Luis Elizondo, the former director of a secret UFO program at the Pentagon. Again from <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/ufos-are-suddenly-a-serious-news-story-you-can-thank-the-guy-from-blink-182-for-that-1.530224">Stars and Stripes</a>: &ldquo;The phenomenon is indeed real,&rdquo; Elizondo said when it was his turn to speak. Just days before, the 22-year Defense Department veteran had submitted a resignation letter to the Pentagon, citing its disregard of &ldquo;overwhelming evidence&rdquo; that unexplained phenomena have been interfering with the U.S. military. Elizondo had overseen the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, quietly created in 2007 by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, D-Nev., with the encouragement of a reclusive Nevada billionaire named Robert Bigelow.</p>

<p><a href="https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/">ToTheStarsAcademy.com</a> Like DeLonge, Bigelow made his fortune through earthly pursuits (real estate) but was fascinated by the otherworldly; he had funded research into crop and cattle mutilations. After he got Reid&rsquo;s attention, Bigelow&rsquo;s aerospace company then won the $22 million contract to run the Pentagon&rsquo;s secret program, as first reported by the New York Times late last year. (Reid and Bigelow did not respond to requests for comment.) Despite its peculiar mandate, Bigelow Aerospace&rsquo;s output was typical of federal bureaucracy: It produced paper. There was a 490-page report on alleged UFO sightings, and a series of studies on experimental physics. One study written for the Defense Intelligence Agency (&ldquo;Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy&rdquo;) urged federal research into interstellar travel and was illustrated with a childish drawing of a dinosaur greeting Albert Einstein through a hole in the space-time continuum.</p>

<p><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tom-delonge-blink-182-feature.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.91x.com/adam/tom-delonge-releasing-non-fiction-book-detailing-ufo-findings/">91x.com</a> But the secret program&rsquo;s collection of weird military videos was what made headlines, starting with the December New York Times article. Whatever is in the videos &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t human, it&rsquo;s not natural, it&rsquo;s under artificial control,&rdquo; says Eric W. Davis, the astrophysicist who wrote the study on wormholes and stargates. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where it comes from. But it&rsquo;s here, and has been here for some time.&rdquo; The good news is that now, maybe we the public will finally get some answers, and if we do, we&rsquo;ll owe a huge amount of gratitude to Tom DeLonge.
