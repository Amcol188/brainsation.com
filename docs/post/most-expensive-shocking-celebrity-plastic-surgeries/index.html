<h2 id="donatella-versace-25-000">Donatella Versace – $25,000</h2>

<p>She is synonymous with her last name in the fashion industry.  As she has aged she has tried to keep herself young.  $25k, might seem like alot, but compared to the other names on this list, it is actually quite cheap.  We&rsquo;re thinking she wishes she had shelled out more money, because she looks sort of inhuman at this point!</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19mostexpensivecelebplasticsurgeries.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19mostexpensivecelebplasticsurgeries-300x169.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jocelyn.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jocelyn-300x195.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/manilow.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/manilow-300x157.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="blake-lively-7-500">Blake Lively – $7,500</h2>

<p>Although the actress, best known for playing Serena van der Woodsen on the TV show <em>Gossip Girl</em>, has never officially confirmed or denied going under the knife, it’s quite apparent that she’s had some work done. In older photos of her, Lively’s nose is clearly thinner than it appears in more recent snapshots. Her eyelids also seem to have received a lift, and she’s likely had skin-smoothing procedures.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/blake-lively.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/blake-lively-300x154.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="dolly-parton-25-000">Dolly Parton – $25,000</h2>

<p>Country legend Dolly Parton has been candid about the plastic surgeries she’s received. In an InTouch interview, she once said that “[a]nybody that’s got the nerve, desire and the money to have surgery, should find a good doctor and just do it.” She’s clearly an advocate of going under the knife!</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dolly-parton.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dolly-parton-300x165.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The singer, now in her 70s, has admitted to breast implants, chin liposuction, fillers, and undereye bag work. But in 2012 she said “These days, I do very little — just fillers and Botox. You owe it to people not to look like a dog if you can help it!”</p>

<h2 id="heidi-montag-1-million">Heidi Montag – $1 Million+</h2>

<p>Heidi Montag, the former reality television star, is a self-proclaimed plastic surgery “addict.” In fact, these days she might be more famous for all the outlandish changes she’s made to her appearance than for her days on MTV’s <em>The Hills</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/montag.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/montag-300x184.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In 2012, Montag confessed to blowing more than a million bucks on surgery. She had 10 procedures in one day, including a nose job, breast implants, a butt enhancement, liposuction, and a brow lift. She blames her love for plastic surgery on being insecure, but now says she regrets going so far off the deep end with it.</p>

<h2 id="megan-fox-8-000">Megan Fox – $8,000</h2>

She has also played roles in films such as the _Transformer _franchise, <em>Jennifer’s Body</em>, and a other less-known B films. Before her procedures, she was already recognized as a beautiful actress, and yet around 2013, people began noticing some changes.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Megan-Fox-630x420.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Megan-Fox-630x420-300x200.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Although she denies it, it is evident that she has had some serious work done. It has been reported that she underwent breast augmentation, cheek implants, lip fillers and Botox. Even though she won’t admit it, the transformation tells all.</p>

<h2 id="natalie-suleman-12-500">Natalie Suleman – $12,500</h2>

<p>Natalie Suleman, better known as “Octomom” gave birth to eight children at once in January, 2009. Her pregnancy and birth gained national attention, and Suleman appeared on numerous talk television shows as the nation followed her and the children.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sulemanbeforeafter2-1.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sulemanbeforeafter2-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>With all of this exposure, came a fair bit of money. After dealing with an eight-child pregnancy, birth, and now raising eight babies, she decided to treat herself. She decided to undergo lip injections, a nose job, and vaginal rejuvenation (for obvious reasons).</p>

<h2 id="pamela-anderson-10-500">Pamela Anderson – $10,500</h2>

<p>Pamela Anderson used to be a household name for her natural beauty, and actress on the hit series _Baywatch._ Also, being a _Playboy_ Bunny certainly helped, along with the numerous adult films she has been a part of.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pamela-Anderson.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pamela-Anderson-300x228.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Although she was once young, and beautiful, time eventually got to her. To fight against time, she underwent numerous surgeries in order to maintain her once sought after look. These surgeries included breast implants and face tightening procedures.</p>

<h2 id="laura-flynn-boyle">Laura Flynn Boyle</h2>

<p>Known mostly for her role in the 1990’s show _Twin Peaks, _as well as her appearance in the comedy film M_en in Black II. _Later in her life, Boyle certainly underwent some cosmetic surgeries. Unfortunately, these surgeries had the opposite effect she wanted, and instead of making her look young, made her look worse than ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lara-Flynn-Boyle-after-plastic-surgery-23.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lara-Flynn-Boyle-after-plastic-surgery-23-300x221.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In 2006, the actress underwent serious surgery which included rhinoplasty, lip augmentation, facial fillers, and a brow lift. In the end, these procedures caused her face to puff up and in turn sag, making her almost unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Pete Burns was the founder of the band Dead or Alive, known for their hit “You Spin Me Round”. During his time in the limelight, he developed a fascination, as well as an addiction to cosmetic surgeries. He was known to have extensive polyacrylamide injections in his lips, cheek implants, and several nose jobs.</p>

<p>After a botched lip job, he underwent around 300 surgeries in order to try and fix his now ruined lips. in an interview, Burns noted, “When I’m 80 and get to heaven I want God to not recognize me”. Burns also admits he has no idea how many times he had surgery throughout his life. He passed away in 2016 due to yet another cosmetic surgery malfunction.</p>
