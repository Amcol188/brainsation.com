<h3 id="the-16-year-old-model-who-was-dubbed-the-most-beautiful-girl-in-the-world-at-the-age-of-six-walked-the-catwalk-for-dolce-gabbana-at-milan-fashion-week-in-a-2017-secret-off-schedule-show">The 16-year-old model who was dubbed the “most beautiful girl in the world” at the age of six walked the catwalk for Dolce &amp; Gabbana at Milan Fashion Week in a 2017 &ldquo;secret&rdquo; off-schedule show.</h3>

<p>Thylane Blondeau found fame at the tender age of four after she made her fashion debut on Jean Paul Gaultier&rsquo;s runway and appeared in several iconic photo shoots. The French teen is now signed with IMG models and boasts more than 1.6 million followers on her Instagram account.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/k-2.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/k-2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-https-goo-gl-images-kygef1"><a href="https://goo.gl/images/KyGEf1"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Blondeau made her debut catwalk appearance for D&amp;G in February of 2017, when they showcased their autumn and winter collection. Known for casting a mix of models and social media influencers, Blondeau was joined on the runway this time around by Hailey Baldwin, Amber Le Bon and Anais Gallagher.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b-12.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b-12.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>As the daughter of football star Patrick Blondeau, the teen beauty fit right into Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana’s penchant for casting celebrity offspring in their shows and ad campaigns. Though Blondeau attended the Tommy Hilfigher show during London Fashion Week, this event marked her first runway appearance of the 2017 season.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/c-11.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/c-11.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-1"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>At 5’6” tall, she is a good deal shorter than the usual height requirements for female models, who typically stand at 5’10” or more. And although the pint-sized Thylane has always been a gorgeous face, her meteoric rise to fame hasn&rsquo;t been an easy one&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-most-beautiful-girl-in-the-world">The Most Beautiful Girl in the World</h3>

<p>The world has seen many photos go viral over the years. From funny animals to the strange and bizarre, and everyday heroes to a witty share on Twitter, there have been thousands of snaps floating around for the internet to obsess over.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/a-14.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/a-14.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-2"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Although 2011 seems like a literal lifetime ago, this one photo will forever stand out from the crowd. Do you remember it? Shortly after the snap emerged online, people started digging into where this star had come from. They wanted to know who &ldquo;the most beautiful girl in the world&rdquo; really was&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="where-did-she-come-from">Where Did She Come From?</h3>

<p>Thylane Blondeau was born in France, to actress mother Véronika Loubry and soccer legend Patrick Blondeau. But depite her privileged pedigree, it looked as though this youngster was going to be famous for her own reasons and in her own unique way.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-3.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-https-goo-gl-images-pbrrrf"><a href="https://goo.gl/images/PBRRrF"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>And if it wasn’t acting or sports, what was Thylane good at? Modeling, that&rsquo;s what! For better or worse, her young age had many people talking. Was it appropriate for a four year old to cavort around in makeup and high heels?</p>

<h3 id="starting-very-young">Starting Very Young</h3>

<p>Many child models begin young. However, Thylane started even younger than most of her modeling gal pals. Her blue eyes and naturally long hair caught the eye of several top tier modeling agencies, and it wasn’t long before the youngster was signed up for her first job.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6-12.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6-12.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-https-goo-gl-images-a3nfxw"><a href="https://goo.gl/images/A3nFXW"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Although many countries don’t allow anyone under the age of 17 to walk the catwalk, Thylane was up there at just four years old! But what came next really got tongues wagging and the gossip columns spinning..</p>

<h3 id="thylane-does-vogue">Thylane Does Vogue</h3>

<p>At just ten years old, Thylane was in for even more controversy than her catwalk debut. The youngster was featured in a special spread for the iconic fashion magazine Vogue, but the world wasn’t done talking about Thylane, yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/q-6.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/q-6.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-3"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>The shoot showed Thylane putting on a heavy amount of makeup as well as wearing high heels. It looked as though the magazine was trying to make Thylane look a lot older than she was, but was it too much for such a little girl? A lot of people seemed to think so&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="was-her-vogue-shoot-inappropriate">Was Her Vogue Shoot Inappropriate?</h3>

<p>It was her shoot for Vogue Enfants that Thylane really rocketed into the stratosphere of fame and internet infamy. Her photos were designed to show off her natural beauty, but many felt as though the pictures were crude and tasteless.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-6.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-6.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-4"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Had the magazine pushed it too far? Many criticized the photos for being unnatural for a 10-year-old girl, as well as suggesting that the adult themes in the pics could force young girls to grow up before they are ready. But really, the controversy was just beginning for the ambitious beauty&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="dividing-the-world">Dividing the World</h3>

<p>It wasn’t long before even psychologists began to offer up their opinions on Thylane and her fame. One leading doctor of the mind, Emma Grey, had plenty to say on the matter.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-9.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-9.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-5"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>She felt that Thylane wasn&rsquo;t emotionally equipped to deal with the backlash of the photographs or the messages they were trying to portray. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be frank,&ldquo; Grey said. &ldquo;These are racy, adult-themed photographs and a young girl doesn&rsquo;t really understand the circumstances. It&rsquo;s disturbing and totally bizarre.&rdquo; But what did Thylane&rsquo;s mother think? Did she agree with Dr. Grey?</p>

<h3 id="mom-veronika-comes-to-her-daughter-s-aid">Mom Veronika Comes to Her Daughter&rsquo;s Aid</h3>

<p>Many saw the photos as inappropriate. However, others saw the flip side of the situation, including Thylane&rsquo;s own mother. Véronika was quick to point out that her daughter had created a lucrative career for herself and that meant she was able to pay for college, buy a car, and travel if and when she wanted.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/u-6.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/u-6.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-6"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Even though she was defending her daughter and their family&rsquo;s decisions, Véronika knew they were about to be in for plenty more negative media attention&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="mom-knows-best">Mom Knows Best</h3>

<p>Although Thylane’s mom defended her daughter’s choices, she knew that she needed to do more to protect her child from the controversy. But what could she do?</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/h-4.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/h-4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-7"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Véronika had been in the world of fame for long enough to know that the social media realm could be extremely harsh, so she quickly shut down her daughter’s pages. That way, no one could get in touch with her or the family&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="just-a-tomboy-at-heart">Just a Tomboy at Heart</h3>

<p>Modeling can conjure up images of makeup and glamour, but for Thylane, it’s not just all about the look. According to the catwalk queen, she enjoys spending her spare time playing the drums, skateboarding, and watching soccer.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-10.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-10.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-8"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>In fact, Thylane admits she is a tomboy when she isn’t modeling! The model credits her love of simple masculine pursuits to the time she spends with her soccer-playing father. But that&rsquo;s not all about Thylane that will surprise you&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="her-acting-career-takes-off">Her Acting Career Takes Off</h3>

<p>As well as her tomboy side from her father, Thylane has also inherited some of her mother’s acting chops. Back in 2015, Thylane starred in a French movie that served as a loose sequel to the Beauty and the Beast story.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-4.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-9"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>Would she be able to pull it off? What did the critics think? The reviews were in, and she was about to have her answer&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="what-s-she-up-to-now">What&rsquo;s She Up to Now?</h3>

<p>It’s been several years since Thylane&rsquo;s first acting gig. Because of the commercial and critical success of her turn as the Beast&rsquo;s love interest Belle, she&rsquo;s been able to keep herself pretty busy these last few years.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j-4.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j-4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-10"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>She may have grown up, but Thylane still has the same amazing beauty that gained her all that attention when she was just four years old. It doesn’t look as though this star will be going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, she&rsquo;s been making some serious headlines&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="running-the-runway">Running the Runway</h3>

<p>Thriteen years on from her first runway appearance and Thylane is still dominating the catwalk.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-7.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-7.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-11"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>In 2017, she was given the opportunity to walk in Paris Fashion Week, which is a huge honor for any model. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really grateful to be here,&rdquo; she said at the time. &ldquo;I love the opportunity to work and be with my friends. It&rsquo;s a blessing.&rdquo; But she got the coolest gift ever for her sixteenth birthday&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="thylane-goes-total-glam-squad">Thylane Goes Total Glam Squad</h3>

<p>As well as hitting the runway, Thylane has also been making more appearances, only this time it&rsquo;s on the red carpet. As a 16th birthday present, the model was asked to become the new face of L’oreal Cosmetics.</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/u-7.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/u-7.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-12"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>After signing up with the company, Thylane&rsquo;s face has appeared at movie premiers, in television ads, and on billboards all over the world. But is she happy with her success?</p>

<h3 id="the-normal-life">The Normal Life</h3>

<p>Being 17 years old can be a difficult time for any teenager, let alone a teen that has been featured at Paris Fashion Week. However, Thylane is determined that her fame won’t stand in the way of her living what she calls &ldquo;a normal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/l-1.jpg"><img src="http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/l-1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="image-credit-http-www-kiwireport-com-beautiful-girl-world-now-13"><a href="http://www.kiwireport.com/beautiful-girl-world-now/"><em>Image Credit</em></a></h5>

<p>When she isn’t being a superstar, Thylane continues to attend a normal school so she can focus on her grades. &ldquo;I want to go to college and get a degree,&rdquo; Thylane said. &ldquo;Modeling doesn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t last forever. I want to expand my mind and then share it with others.&rdquo; So what does Thylane have planned for her future?</p>

<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h3>

<p>It appears as if being branded &ldquo;the most beautiful girl in the world&rdquo; was only the beginning for this young star. She is still rocking the modeling world after all these years with her good looks, effortless charm, and witty intelligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/REstln76c0Y">https://youtu.be/REstln76c0Y</a> Thylane has built a huge fanbase for herself thanks to her social media presence and continues to represent L’Oreal. Plus, Thylane has a short film about her career coming out, as well as plans to seriously pursue an acting career here in the United States. Life couldn’t get much better for Thylane and we wish her all the best!</p>
