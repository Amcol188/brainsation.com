      <description>One of the major factors in treating cancer is catching the disease early enough to attack it and stop it from spreading. Well, scientists from England have found a way to catch some types of cancer before they even start.
Health.mil Experts are hailing this as a major breakthrough in humanity&amp;rsquo;s continued fight against the dreaded disease. Here&amp;rsquo;s more from The Independent website: A new blood test that allows doctors to detect 10 types of cancer years before a person becomes sick with the disease has been developed by scientists.</description>

      <description>Kilauea still remains very active and today was rocked by a massive explosion that sent a plume of ash 1 mile up into the atmosphere. In addition, the geothermal fireworks triggered an earthquake that measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. The good news is that that&amp;rsquo;s strong enough to cause a tsunami.

      <description>In June of 1965 astronauts James McDivitt and Ed Pilot took part in the Gemini IV mission launched by NASA. The purpose of the mission was to show that humans could stay in space for extended lengths of time. It was the 2nd manned Gemini space flight and the 10th manned spaceflight by the US.
Wikimedia Commons For four days, McDivitt and White circled the Earth 66 times, and even took the first spacewalk ever by an American astronaut, as White floated free outside of the spacecraft for about 20 minutes.</description>

      <description>It seems most humans love their dogs more than they love themselves. Well, at least we usually treat our dog&amp;rsquo;s bodies better than our own. We put off doctor visits for ourselves, but never miss one for out pets. And while we make sure they have the best pet food we can give them, we &amp;ldquo;wolf down&amp;rdquo; (pun intended) whatever food is fast and convenient. This technique started making the rounds on the Internet after a Twitter user whose dog had choked on a piece of plastic Tweeted out instructions.</description>

Well, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Mars rover did, and ever since December of 2016, it&amp;rsquo;s been unable to do its job. But, after over a year of brainstorming and hacking by the folks over at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the rover is once again hard at work collecting and analyzing samples from the Martian terrain in its onboard laboratory.</description>

Some companies focus on ridding older homes and buildings of asbestos related materials, some provide deep cleaning services to hospitals and other environments, and some crews are dispersed to the scene of environmental disasters, such as oil slicks, to try and clean up the environment and return it to its natural state.

      <description>Mummified animal remains weren&amp;rsquo;t all that rare in ancient Egypt. In fact, over the years, scientists have encountered snake, cat, crocodile, and dog mummies. So, when a mummified hawk was discovered, scientists just added it to the collection thinking it was just another prized pet, only it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hawk. Here&amp;rsquo;s the story from CNET.com:

      <description>Neutrinos are mysterious particles that have the ability to pass through matter without interacting with it at all. Scientists have theorized about them for decades, but have been unable to turn up any concrete evidence to prove they exist. Until now. Here&amp;rsquo;s more from LiveScience.com:
Octanis.org Back in the mid-1990s, the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND), an experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, found evidence of a mysterious new particle: a &amp;ldquo;sterile neutrino&amp;rdquo; that passes through matter without interacting with it.</description>

      <description>As our hearts go out to the volcano victims in Guatemala, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded every day of the ticking time bomb that is Kilauea in Hawaii. To add to the drama, the big island of Hawaii was hit with a rash of earthquakes yesterday, with the most intense one measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale.
USGS With an earthquake that strong, there&amp;rsquo;s always the fear that it will create a tsunami, but officials said that they did not expect that to be the case with this one.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one positive from this story it&amp;rsquo;s that the advent of drone technology has been very helpful in helping scientists evalulate the situation at Kilauea and anticipate what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next. The bad news is that the recent drone footage scientists observed of the volcano&amp;rsquo;s crater indicates that something very, very bad is on its way.
USGS Basically, the new footage shows that one of Kilauea&amp;rsquo;s main craters has developed alarming new cracks, some of which are spewing out some pretty intense steam.</description>

      <description>When a DUI attorney defends a client charged with drunk driving, the first thing a good lawyer will do is try to find a reason to get the charges dismissed.
Pixabay Did the arresting officer make a mistake? Was there an underlying medical condition which led to the defendant appearing drunk? Was there an inaccurate measurement of the alcohol level? While some people might scoff at these attempts as those of a sleazy lawyer trying to game the system, sometimes they actually do have merit.</description>

The second is that, if you&amp;rsquo;re a caring human being, and you&amp;rsquo;re a nurse, you&amp;rsquo;re never really off the clock.

Pixabay Did the arresting officer make a mistake? Was there an underlying medical condition which led to the defendant appearing drunk? Was there an inaccurate measurement of the alcohol level? While some people might scoff at these attempts as those of a sleazy lawyer trying to game the system, sometimes they actually do have merit.</description>

Earthquakes associated with them can be strong enough to trigger tsunamis in some ocean regions, and the ash and fog that they spew forth can impact areas that are downwind for miles. It&amp;rsquo;s the latter effect that&amp;rsquo;s taking place thanks to the Kilauea eruption in Hawaii.

      <description>From the microwave and teflon, to penicillin and viagra, many inventions and discoveries owe themselves to chance or a total accident, and that&amp;rsquo;s the story of this next breakthrough in the fight against cancer. This story comes to us from Swansea University in the UK where British and Indian scientiests recently discovered that nanoparticles from tea leaves can actually destroy lung cancer cells.

      <description>Although Christopher Colombus has been credited with discovering North America, others have laid claim to the distinction long before him. One legend says that the Welsh prince Madoc, for example, landed in the America over 300 years before Colombus. Still others claim that the Vikings landed and even established a settlement here. It&amp;rsquo;s this latter theory that&amp;rsquo;s gaining a little more credence thanks to an observation from space.

We have robots that can walk, run, fight, cook meals, and grow human organs. In addition, today&amp;rsquo;s aritificial intelligence can teach itself to learn, and kick anyone&amp;rsquo;s ass in Jeopardy, but in 1939, when the first &amp;ldquo;Moto Man&amp;rdquo; robot was unveiled at the Worlds Fair in New York City, the vision for the future was a little bit different.</description>

NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstad/Sean Doran The image clearly shows Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Great Red Spot, which is about 1.3 times as wide as Earth. The uniqueness of this photo, however, is due to its view. Prior to Juno&amp;rsquo;s arrival there in 2016, we were unable to get an image like this.</description>

      <description>All eyes this morning are focused on the Puna Geothermal Venture power plant on the big island of Hawaii as lava from the erupting Kilauea volcano gets closer to the site. The plant provides 25% of the power for the island, and its loss would be devastating, but it&amp;rsquo;s the toxic element that has people more concerned.
PXHere From NPR: The plant harvests hot liquid and steam from underground wells to drive turbine generators for electricity, which is then sold to the state&amp;rsquo;s utility.</description>

Were this a story on rhinos or elephants, the first and most logical guess would be the human element, but this time the hunters are other ocean dwellers.

There&amp;rsquo;s now a fast moving lava flow that&amp;rsquo;s headed straight toward the residential area and isolated about 40 homes, prompting a dramatic helicopter rescue of homeowners who&amp;rsquo;d been trying to wait out the volcano.</description>

Wikimedia Commons A big part of a government’s ability to wrangle in the population is its co-opting of large corporations under the banner of carrying out the ‘state’s business’. This unofficial merger becomes especially dangerous when it is controlled by what President Dwight Eisenhower called the ‘military industrial complex’.</description>

CNN Supersonic commercial flights have been hiatus since 2003, after the British-French Concorde went belly up to due to expensive operations and prohibitive passenger fares. While aeronautic enthusiasts mourned the end of such flights, those living in the path of the incoming and outgoing airplanes felt relief that the loud, bone rattling sonic booms of the Concorde would no longer be heard.</description>

      <description>Astronomers and other scientists focused on finding a habitable &amp;lsquo;earth-like&amp;rsquo; exoplanet in the cosmos have many requirements that have to be met before they seriously zero in on a candidate. One of these requirements is that the planet have a sizable iron core that would lend itself to the creation and maintenance of a magnetosphere.

Regular skywatchers know where to look to see the meteor shower that will be taking place this weekend and again in October but for the rest of us, here&amp;rsquo;s where and when to look.</description>

      <description>As the debate about climate change rages on, scientists are offering some new evidence to the argument in the form of extreme temperature recordings. This latest one comes from Pakistan where scientists documented a world record temperature for the month of April. The temperature was recorded at a weather station in Nawabshah, Pakistan, where it was 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade!

Nuclear fission would help us break our dependence on fossil fuels and help us power longer flights into deep space. Well, NASA has been experimenting with a nuclear fission power system and, so far, the results have gone extremely well. From IFLScience: The system is called Kilopower, and it involves using the heat generated by uranium to produce power.</description>

If you look toward the southeastern skies this weekend in the hours before dawn, the chances are good that you can see a pretty good meteor shower eminating from the constellation of Aquarius. What you may not realize, however, is that this meteor shower, and another one hitting our skies in October, is a direct result of Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet. From EarthSky.org: Halley’s Comet, proud parent of two meteor showers, swings into the inner solar system about every 76 years.</description>

      <description>Australia’s Outback has been less crowded the past eighty years since the believed extinction of the thylacine or Tasmanian Tiger. The strange looking beast was a large stripped dingo-looking marsupial who entered the pages of history in 1936, when the last of its kind died in a Washington, D.C. zoo. Recent headway made by scientists looking to resurrect the woolly mammoth, however, have given biologists hope that the Tiger can once more roam the rugged terrain of the Outback.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s the story from NPR: Australia&amp;rsquo;s government is investing 500 million Australian dollars (more than $377 million U.S.) to protect the Great Barrier Reef, which has been struggling to cope with storm damage, coral-eating starfish and bleaching events triggered by warmer oceans.</description>

      <description>Flickr Famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking passed away in March of this year, but his final theory about the Universe has been published today. The study, published in conjunction with former student and frequent collaborator Thomas Hertog, addresses the conflict that arise between quantum mechanics and Einstein&amp;rsquo;s general relativity theory. From EarthSky.org: Hawking and Hertog’s latest study deals specifically with a subset of Big Bang theory, called eternal inflation. Most modern Big Bang theories incorporate the idea of an inflation, which calls for an exponential expansion of space in the universe’s first fraction of a second.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s surprising, though, is that there&amp;rsquo;s a counter part to this in the animal kingdom. Popular Mechanics has written an article that tells of a certain species of ant that acts, in essence, like a suicide bomber.
