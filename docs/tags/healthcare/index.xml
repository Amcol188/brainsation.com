      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary about wanting to tweak your appearance a bit, but for most people, there are boundaries. While some are just getting used to the idea of surgery, others are pushing the boundaries of safety in order to max out their look. There is perhaps no better example of this than Valdir Segato, the body builder with a risky goal in mind.
1. Humble Beginnings Mirror Now famous for his abnormally-bulging muscles, Valdir Segato wasn&amp;rsquo;t always spending large portions of his everyday routine focusing on his looks.</description>

      <description>Law enforcement officials were called to a spa in Washington, D.C. on May 6. Once they arrived on scene they discovered the body of 28-year-old Ascendance Biomedical founder Aaron Traywick in a flotation therapy tank, reports Independent. Traywick gained recent notoriety when he injected himself with an untested herpes drug while in front of an audience. Traywick and his company advocated for biohacking, a broad term applied to methods of treating disease or overall health without the aid of pharmaceutical products.</description>

      <description>Kendra Jackson of Omaha, Nebraska counted herself lucky in 2013 when she walked away from a car accident with a minor head injury resulting from her head hitting the dashboard of the car she was in. The bruising slowly went away. The pain receded as well&amp;hellip;at least temporarily.
Week Facts Years after her accident Jackson began to be plagued with debilitating headaches, dizziness, sleeplessness and a constant runny nose. Her primary care physician diagnosed her symptoms as results of severe allergies that were causing sinus infections.</description>

      <description>Can the golden years in life still be a time of sexual desire and intimacy? This is the question asked by scientists out of Michigan. According to a report from the University of Michigan referenced by The Guardian, there is a sizeable chunk of seniors that are still sexually active and a much larger cadre of elders who say that sex is important in all stages of life.
Pixabay The Michigan research found that 40% of those surveyed between the ages of 65 and 80 were sexually active.</description>

      <description>Fasting has long been a part of the world&amp;rsquo;s major religions and has even caught on within the past few years as a health trend here in the United States. Some people fast intermittently, restricting their food intake to just a few hours a day, while some bio-hackers are fasting for days at a time. Scientists are now taking a closer look at fasting and its health benefits, and they&amp;rsquo;re making some interesting discoveries.</description>

      <description>Cells with Epstein Barr Virus | Wikimedia Commons[/caption] In a stunning bit of news, the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital has announced that a team of its researchers have concluded that the injection at least some forms of viral DNA into the human lymphatic system may be causing the onset of seven debilitating diseases. IFLScience writes that a study of patients who received shots of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) as part of a vaccination process against mononucleosis (mono) had increased chances of developing autoimmune diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk, the founder and current CEO of Tesla, Inc., has been sleeping on a couch at his company’s Fremont, California plant lately following a slowdown in production that has caught the attention of the public in the last few weeks.

When the model was announced, Musk told the public that it would run consumers $35,000, a very reasonable price, to purchase the car and that the California facility would pump out 5,000 vehicles a week.</description>

      <description>Turn on any TV show or watch any commercial and what you will most likely see are scenes with characters consisting of strong, smart women and dopey and weak men. Those of you with children in high school or college have most likely heard of Academia’s crusade against ‘toxic masculinity’.

Now, one Texas university is attempting to slap a medical motivation behind dangerous masculinity, reports PJ Media.

Tyranny of the Technocrats At the University of Texas at Austin, the Counseling and Mental Health Center has initiated a campaign to tell men that their traits of masculinity are barriers to a balanced mental health.</description>

      <description>The nuclear age has taken to the high seas. This statement has nothing to do with nuclear-powered submarines, aircraft carriers or ice-breaking naval vessels. The ground-breaking, or rather ground-leaving, event involves nuclear reactors perched atop floating barges and hauled out to sea.

‘Nuclear Titanic’ On April 28, a Russian planned and constructed nuclear facility was successfully tugged from its berthing area in the historic naval port of St. Petersburg to Murmansk.</description>

      <description>The assassination of President John F. Kennedy took place over 50 years ago in Dallas, Texas, yet conspiracy theories still abound as to what happened on that fateful November day. Now, thanks to advancements in technology and the ability to digitally analyze audio and video footage of the shooting and its aftermath, one research firm thinks they&amp;rsquo;ve solved a major part of the puzzle.

From IFLScience.com According to official reports, Lee Harvey Oswald was the prime (and only) suspect.</description>

      <description>In the second decade of the 20th Century, American society was steeped in the opulence and hedonism of the ‘Roaring 20s’. The Great War was over and economic progress had returned big time to the United States. The zeitgeist was the closest Americans came to the French joie de vivre.

According to some sociologists, the generation during that time (the Crisis stage) was the artist group. The 1920s gave birth to bohemians and flappers, so it would indeed appear that the authors were right.</description>

      <description>All throughout the 20th century, one of the signature features of the future that Americans looked forward to was the possibility of flying cars. Getting in your car and, just like George Jetson, blasting off to work and then home again. Well, it looks like the future is not that far off.

The world may be on the cusp of the skies being filled with flying taxis. The European company, Airbus, who produces civilian and military aircraft, has released video of tests of its ‘Vahana’ vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone taxi.</description>

      <description>Donald Olson is an amateur sleuth, but the mysteries he solves don&amp;rsquo;t put killers behind bars or reveal the identities of murderers in some sort of overly dramatic third act. No, Olson tackles the mysteries that artists and great figures in history have left for the rest of us to figure out.

The Art Detective From Atlas Obscura: An astrophysicist and forensic astronomer, Olson uses quantitative methods to answer questions raised by artwork, literature, and historical accounts—not the heady ones, but the basic, surprisingly slippery who, what, when, and where.</description>

      <description>Today, people tend to think of sloths as cute harmless creatures. Their images are all over the internet and videos of them on YouTube garner thousands &amp;ndash; and even millions of views. Their prehistoric ancestors, however, were a little different.

Over 10,000 years ago in what is now the New Mexico White Sands National Monument at least one pre-historic hunter followed the trail of a large beast. At some point, the hunter caught up to the animal causing the beast to rear up on its hind legs in an attempt to scare away the hunter or, if that failed, defend itself.</description>

      <description>The Pleistocene Epoch is the term scientists use to describe the last ice age that ended about 11,700 years ago. It was at about this time, almost 12,000 years ago that a group of people in Siberia (the land where the ice age never really ended), carved a tree into a human like wooden idol almost 5 meters long.

Fast forward to 1894, when gold prospectors discovered the idol while digging up a peat bog near the Russian city Yekaterinburg.</description>

      <description>It looks and sounds like something out of a sci-fi horror flick. With eyes that glow a menacing red, white fangs and inhuman howls, a new creature is stalking the rice paddies and agricultural fields of Japan.

It is called the Super Monster Wolf and stands 20 inches tall and is around 25 ½ inches long. Oh and it costs about $4,800 to buy. The creature is a solar powered robot wolf designed to scare away scavengers and other animals from farms and rice paddies throughout Japan, writes The Sun.</description>

      <description>The Northeast has definitely experienced some intense weather this spring and a few weeks ago, a massive storm grew miles above the Big Apple. The energy it created gave birth to thunder storms during a major snow event.

On March 7, first New York City and then northern New Jersey, experienced thunder snow during a strong coastal front. In the process billions of ice crystals high up in the atmosphere moving at a frenetic pace due to the winds of the storm, began charging each other with electrical energy This rapid movement charges an area of the atmosphere, which in turn draws more ice crystals to it like a magnet.</description>

      <description>In a bid to help biologists better understand the aquatic environs of whales and how humans impact them, researchers from San Diego State University (SDSU) have completed a crucial examination of one ocean species.

Discover Magazine writes that the results “will help researchers better protect these massive mammals of the sea.” Can You Hear Me Now? Thanks to a large computed tomography (CT) machine used to scan solid-fuel rocket engines, SDSU scientists were able to analyze the interior of a deceased 11-foot young minke whale found beached years before.</description>

      <description>Like it or not, artificial intelligence is advancing at a phenomenal rate. While some people fear the Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box that AI will open up and others are, at the very least, leery of the rise of the machine, some people are optimistic and welcoming of the new technology. Jeff Bezos is hoping you fall into the third category.

Here&amp;rsquo;s the story from Bloomberg: The retail and cloud computing giant has embarked on an ambitious, top-secret plan to build a domestic robot, according to people familiar with the plans.</description>

      <description>A multi-generational group of researchers have published the results of an 80-year-long study tracking the lives nearly 2,000 Americans. The study looked to answer an eternal question that has had philosophers, theologians and scientists consumed with curiosity: what is the secret to happiness?

Happy Man[/caption] The Company You Keep IFLScience writes that the study was handled by “a team of scientists at Harvard University” that discovered, thanks to evolving medical research and technology, the key to happiness was the development and maintenance of strong relationships with other people.</description>

      <description>California is used to earthquakes. There are small to medium tremors that occur monthly throughout the year. The last major quake to strike California was the shallow 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, often referred to as the ‘World Series Quake’ since it struck during a MLB playoff game. The quake killed 67 people, injured 3,000 and cost $5 billion in damages.
  Before that, in 1906, a vicious 7.</description>

      <description>It’s not the equivalent of the Scope Monkey Trial of 1925, but another legal case with a primate at the center of it has found its way into American culture. Unlike the Scopes trial, which addressed the weighty subject of biological evolution, this case is a comical farce of a lawsuit over photo selfies.

‘Monkey See Monkey Sue’ The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has recently ruled on a 2011 lawsuit filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) over photographs inadvertently taken of an Indonesian crested macaque, named Naruto, by British nature photographer David Slater, reports the Huffington Post.</description>

The Drink Has (Frost)bite Griffiths, a frequent contender in extreme racings, participated this last winter in the Yukon Arctic Ultra. The race is a punishing 300-mile jaunt via foot, dogsled and mountain bikes through inhospitable freezing landscapes, with temperatures getting down to 58 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, making it one of the coldest races in the world.</description>

      <description>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the same may be said of luck. A twenty-year-old Colorado native named Dylan McWilliams may either be the most unlucky or luckiest man, reports Sky News.

On April 19, while enjoying a two week vacation to Hawaii, McWilliams was on his surfboard in the early morning waters of Shipwreck&amp;rsquo;s Beach, 50 yards off of Poipu. The avid surfer and survival instructor was enjoying a beautiful morning when he suddenly felt something clamp down on one of his submerged legs.</description>

      <description>After two years of trying to determine what it was that was drifting above the clouds off the coast of Chile on November 11 of 2014, that nation&amp;rsquo;s version of our Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the CEFAA, has recently released nearly ten minutes of footage of an apparent UFO that has left Chilean officials at a loss to explain, reports Huffington Post.

On the date mentioned above, two Chilean naval aviators flying an Airbus Cougar AS-532 helicopter on a routine daytime patrol, spotted what they later described as a white, semi-oval shaped &amp;ldquo;flat, elongated structure that had two thermal spotlights like discharges that did not coincide with the axel of motion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last week a Space X Falcon 9 Rocket took off from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida and launched a very special satellite named TESS into Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit. TESS stands for Transiting Exoplanet Surevey Satellite and its mission is to discover new planets. NASA is very excited about the possibilities.

From Space.com: &amp;ldquo;TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,&amp;rdquo; TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday (April 15).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 40 years since Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s horror masterpiece The Shining hit the silver screens of America. The movie, starring Jack Nicholson, is based on a 1977 Stephen King novel of the same name and was tremendous hit for Nicholson, Kubrick, and King when it hit theaters in the summer of 1980.

Stanley Kubrick[/caption] Many people know that much, but what you may not know is that King wrote his novel based on a paranormal experience he had while staying at The Staley Hotel in Estes Park, CO in 1974.</description>

      <description>A people should never fear their government, for that is tyranny. The opposite, the government fearing the people, is the guarantor of freedom. Unfortunately, we suffer under the ‘aegis’ of a meddling centralized government masquerading as a benevolent patriarch. Agencies like the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Security Agency to name a few, operate in the shadows of unconstitutionality and violations of human rights.</description>

      <description>It seems like we have these predictions at least a couple of times a year. Some predictions usually occur in the fall, around the Jewish New Year. Enjoy your weekend, folks because according to some Christian eschatologists and numerologists, Monday April 23 will be the end of the world, reports the UK’s Express. Those prophesizing the imminent end are divided into two camps; those that believe our termination will come at the arrival of a mysterious alien planet referred to as ‘Planet X’ or Nibiru and the other camp that says our end will come as Jesus Christ arrives for the Second Coming.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk is a visionary. His Tesla brand has been the hottest thing in the automotive industry, and we&amp;rsquo;re just a few months removed from him launching a convertible into space with two Falcon rocket boosters that returned to Earth and landed themselves.

As a forward thinker and futurist, he&amp;rsquo;s planning a mission to Mars and warning Americans about the dangers of the advent of artificial intelligence. After viewing this next report, however, it seems someone should be warning Mr Musk about the problems in his own company.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that as World War II was winding down and Germany&amp;rsquo;s defeat became imminent that many Nazis fled to South America where they established new lives for themselves in countries such as Argentina and Brazil. Most notably among these were Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele.

Well, earlier this week off the coast of Denmark, researchers discovered the wreckage of a German submarine that was long rumored to have played a pivotal role in carrying the Nazis to South America.</description>

      <description>When it comes to combatting the rise in crimes of sexual violence against children, the nation of India is done fooling around. Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially approved an ordinance which allows the death penalty to be handed down to anyone caught raping a child under the age of 12.

Even though the ordinance will require parliamentary approval within the next six months for it to become a law, child rapists can be prosecuted under this ordinance in the mean time.</description>

      <description>Each year for the past 10 years NASA has conducted airborne missions over both of Earth&amp;rsquo;s polar regions to map land and sea ice. On April 14, as part of this year&amp;rsquo;s mission, scientist John Sonntag noticed something he&amp;rsquo;d never seen before. There were random circles poking through the ice exposing the ocean water below.

So, as they flew about 50 miles northwest of Canada&amp;rsquo;s Mackenzie River Delta, Sonntag snapped a picture of the strange circles from the window of the plane.</description>

In the late afternoon of April 17, an unidentified woman entered her home, weary from hours at her job, to find someone had already gone into her house and was still there.</description>
