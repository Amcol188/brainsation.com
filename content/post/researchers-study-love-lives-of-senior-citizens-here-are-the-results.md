Can the golden years in life still be a time of sexual desire and intimacy? This is the question asked by scientists out of Michigan. According to a report from the University of Michigan referenced by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/03/sex-a-key-part-of-life-for-people-over-65-study-says), there is a sizeable chunk of seniors that are still sexually active and a much larger cadre of elders who say that sex is important in all stages of life.

More than 50 percent reported having ‘make out’ sessions with their spouse or partner. “We recognise that sex and sexual health is something that is very important to the health and wellbeing of older people but is not something that gets a lot of attention,” said Dr Erica Solway from the, who was involved in the research. When asked if sex is important to a relationship at any age, 84% of men and 69% of women between 65 and 80, responded that it is important. Of the women polled, 12% reported having a strong interest in sex, while more than 50% of men said the same. Far fewer men were “extremely or very” happy with their sex life compared with women.

The Guardian writes that “a quarter of those aged between 76 and 80 reported being sexually active, compared with 46% of those aged 65-70.” Prof Josie Tetley of Manchester Metropolitan University, who has carried out British versions of the study endorsed the Michigan study: “Evidenced-based data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing has identified that sex and intimacy are important issues of ageing,” she said. “However, our research recognises that sex and intimacy is not all about penetrative sex, and we are looking at how sex and intimacy can be supported in later life through health and relationship support.”

I think we as a society have to agree that older people have a right to good sexual health too, because every message is always about younger people.” There were a few surprises in the research. Sex appears to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular health of women, but on men it had no effect. What was also interesting is that 18% of men and 3% of women in the 65-80 age group claimed to have taken medications or supplements in the last two years to improve their sexual function.
