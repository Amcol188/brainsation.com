Did you know that the son of NBA legend and arguably the best basketball player of all time also shoots hoops?

Marcus Jordan played college ball for the UCF Knights, but never was able to carve out a career like his father.

When Marcus was a freshman, UCF was in the final year of a five-year contract with Adidas, but Jordan insisted on wearing Nike Air Jordan shoes out of loyalty to his father. This eventually prompted Adidas to terminate its sponsorship deal with the Knights.

Be sure to let us know in the comments which celeb kid you enjoyed learning about the most!
