In this day and age of escalating crime, it is understandable that people living alone, especially women, feel a bit unsecure. Those suffering from this condition can and usually get a dog or alarm system, but what about those who live in pet-free apartments or townhouses?

A solution may be in the offering from Leopalace21 Corp, a Japanese firm that designed a program to ward off possible trespassers or thieves. **The Shadow People** For those living alone in angst, Leopalace21 is close to finalizing an app for a smart phone they developed in which video of a shadowy contour is projected onto window curtains in order to simulate that the living space is inhabited by a man, writes [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shadow-boxing-security-japan_us_5ade165ee4b036e7aeb5408f).

Dubbed “Man on the Curtain”, the app currently projects a dozen different shadows that include among other, a man boxing, doing karate, practicing his baseball bat swing, vacuuming, playing a guitar and even getting dressed. Due to popular demand, the company is thinking of adding dozens more projections to the app. **Is Anyone Home?**

The proposed addition of more projections also may silence critics of the app who say that a smart criminal may who is stalking a woman or a residence may eventually figure out the ruse and be better at detecting similar living quarters using the app. Keiichi Nakamura, manager of the firm’s advertising department, responded to the criticism by stating, “If projecting a shadow makes a woman an easy target by showing criminals there’s nobody home, that would put the cart before the horse,” he said.

“So we’d like to commercialize it once we add variety, such as releasing a new video every day.”
