It seems like we have these predictions at least a couple of times a year. Some predictions usually occur in the fall, around the Jewish New Year. Enjoy your weekend, folks because according to some Christian eschatologists and numerologists, Monday April 23 will be the end of the world, reports the UK’s [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/948908/End-of-the-world-2018-David-Meade-April-23). Those prophesizing the imminent end are divided into two camps; those that believe our termination will come at the arrival of a mysterious alien planet referred to as ‘Planet X’ or Nibiru and the other camp that says our end will come as Jesus Christ arrives for the Second Coming.

**It’s the End of the World as We Know it…Or is it?** Why April 23? According to [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/04/14/could-world-come-to-end-on-april-23-are-biblical-end-times-finally-upon-us.html) “the end times dates back to astrological constellations appearing on November 23, matching the book of Revelation 12:1-2.” The verses prophesize:

_“And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.”_ On September 23, 2017 our solar systems constellations are said to have delivered this sign. On that date the constellation Virgo (the virgin woman) appeared in the night sky with the sun positioned over the virgin’s left shoulder and the moon positioned at her feet. Above the virgin’s head were a dozen stars made up of the Leo constellation and Mercury, Mars and Venus.

The woman is said to be in pain for want of giving birth, meaning she was close to delivery. April 23, 2018 is seven months from the date of this sign, but the woman was already in pain in September making it possible that she was already one or two months pregnant. The significance of this prophecy, which appears to have more relevance to the birth of Jesus than any imminent apocalypse, is beyond the scope of this article. What is significant is that a famous numerologist is crying foul about the April 23 date.

**Close but Not Yet** David Meade, a Christian numerologist and dabbler in mysteries, says that the End Times are upon us, but that the kickoff will not be April 23 but sometime between May and December of this year. Meade has authored fourteen books about Armageddon and has announced numerous End Times dates over the years.

Unlike most other numerologists and eschatologists, Meade states that “Nibiru is here and the earth will be prepared for the next event on its calendar. That’s all in the Book of Revelation, too.”

The next event, according to Meade, will be the return of Christ during the Rapture, a time when the souls of believers ascend to heaven and the unrighteous are left behind to endure 7 years of a horrible Tribulation.

**A Hoax?** Meade’s track record and the claims of scientists casts a huge pall of doubt over the prophecy. Express quotes Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, as calling the entire theory a “hoax”. “I don't know what to say except that it's nonsense,” McDowell stated, “Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an Internet hoax. There is no factual basis for these claims.”
