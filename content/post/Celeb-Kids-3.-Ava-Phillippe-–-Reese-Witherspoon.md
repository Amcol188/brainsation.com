No, you’re not looking at two photos of Reese Witherspoon!

The one on the left is Miss “Legally Blonde” herself, and the cute little toddler she’s holding is none other than her daughter with Ryan Phillippe, Ava.

But what about the gal on the right?

That’s Ava today, now that she’s all grown up!

And just recently, she starred in the lookbook for Rodarte’s 2018 Fall collection alongside Black Panther star Danai Gurira, Hong Chau, Tessa Thompson and Kirsten Dunst.

Despite her preference for privacy and a low profile, it’s obvious Ava was born to be Hollywood royalty.

> “When people dream of being famous, they don’t really understand what they’re wishing for,” said Ava. “It’s like what foreigners think about the United States before they move here. The thing itself and the idea of the thing are too completely different animals.”

Up next we’ve got Billy Joel’s daughter, Alexa Ray…
