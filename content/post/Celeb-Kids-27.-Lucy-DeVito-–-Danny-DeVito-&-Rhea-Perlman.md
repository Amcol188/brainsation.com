As is expected with most celebrity kids, DeVito and Perlman’s daughter Lucy followed her parents’ footsteps.

But unlike many untalented celeb offspring, Lucy DeVito has some serious acting chops and a real flair for comedy.

She has made appearances in DeadBeat, as well as a hilarious turn in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

In 2008, DeVito starred as Anne Frank in a production of Anne Frank at the Intiman Theatre in Seattle, Washington, to critical acclaim.
