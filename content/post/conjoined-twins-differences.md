### "We definitely have different styles," says Abby. "Brittany's a lot more into neutrals and pearls, stuff like that. But I would rather have it be more fun and bright and colorful!"

While Abby is seen as the "outspoken" sister and will always win the argument about what they are going to wear, Brittany says her twin also has a softer side.

"She's really sensitive," said Brittany. "People don't usually realize that."

### The Hensel twins also respond differently to coffee. After a few cups Brittany's heart rate increases, but Abby is not affected. They also have different body temperatures!

"I can be a totally different temperature than Brittany," said Abby. "A lot of times our hands are different temperatures and I get super hot way faster."

And despite the fact that the twins share an immune system, Brittany tends to get sick more often than Abby.

"It's because she's sweeter and the germs are just more attracted to her," said Abby, laughing at her sister. "She's just unlucky she's so nice!"

But there's one thing the girls definitely agree on these days...
