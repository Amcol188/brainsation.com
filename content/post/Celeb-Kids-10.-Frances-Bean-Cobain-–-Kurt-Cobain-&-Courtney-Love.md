Frances Bean Cobain spent much of her childhood being raised by different people.

Having been taken by child protective services when she was just two weeks old, Frances Bean knows a thing or two about resilience.

“I don’t blame my parents for the mistakes they made,” she said. “I’m actually a stronger person for it. I can see that now.”

After her father died, Frances spent years bouncing between her mother, aunts, and her paternal grandmother.

But despite her “less than ideal” childhood, she grew up to be a fine woman and a talented artist.

She regularly opens critically-acclaimed shows that feature her original paintings, sculptures, and installations.

Frances, who has also appeared in various fashion magazines over the years, is worth an estimated $170 million and has a “good relationship” with her mother now.
