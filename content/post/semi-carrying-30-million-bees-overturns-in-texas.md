People in the vicinity of Paris, Texas have been advised to call authorities if they see a giant swarm of bees attached to anything on their property. This is because a semi truck hauling 15 - 30 million bees overturned on the highway this past Monday.

[eParisExtra.com](https://eparisextra.com/local-news/roads-clear-semi-truck/) Here's more from the [CBSlocal.com](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/06/01/semi-carrying-millions-of-bees-overturns-on-east-texas-highway/): One witness said as her truck approached the scene, hundreds of bees buzzed around the vehicle. “It wasn’t enough to block out the sun, but we could tell it wasn’t normal. That’s when we saw the semi on its side and the beekeepers,” she described. Multiple agencies came out to help redirect traffic from the area and clear the road of the bee boxes that fell from the truck. Local bee keepers were called in to help move the bees to a safer location and try to redirect the bees back into their hives, according to KXII-TV. They plan to move a queen in to try to attract more bees back to the hive for removal.

[KXII.com](http://www.kxii.com/content/news/Truck-carrying-millions-of-bees-overturns-483893671.html) Police officers in the area told CBS19-TV they don’t recall ever seeing an accident like this, and fortunately, several of their first responders who were stung are all alright. They advised if a swarm has attached to something on a person’s property that they all 903-784-6688, option ‘0’. Police told CBS19-TV that people shouldn’t kill the bees either as, “they are very important to the ecosystem and humans. If you have someone who is allergic to stings, please be careful in the area of the crash.” The truck driver wasn’t injured in the crash. Here's the full statement that the Paris Police Dept released on their Facebook page:

_Here's the latest 'buzz' on the truck tractor semi-trailer roll over at US 271 and Loop 286 which happened yesterday morning. Roads are open and debris has been removed. There are still bees in the area and will remain in the area for some time. Bee keepers have set up a hive and will be moving a queen in to try to attract more back to the hive for removal. We train for many different hazarodus material releases which occur in vehicle crashes, we don't recall one for trucks hauling bees. Several of our 1st responders received stings and all are okay. A special thanks to the many local bee keepers who came out to help. If you do have a swarm that attaches to something on your property, please give us a call 903-784-6688, option '0'. Please don't kill them, they are very important to the ecosystem and humans. If you have someone who is allergic to stings, please be careful in the area of the crash._ According the comments on the post, there were definitely a few people in need of assistance:
