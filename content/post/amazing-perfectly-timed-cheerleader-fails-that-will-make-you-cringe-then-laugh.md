Cheerleading began as a way to motivate sports teams during gameplay with positive team spirit. As time has gone on, it's really evolved into a sport of its own. Cheer competitions are now held all around the world and feature groups of incredibly talented athletes. For a sport so focused on gymnastics and routines, there's a lot of work that goes into making the perfect cheer. Luckily for us, that means there's plenty of footage and photographs of what happens when something goes wrong! We've put together a list of 20 hilarious cheerleading fails that were captured at the perfect moment. Try not to cringe your whole way through!

## When It All Comes Crashing Down

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) One of the worst parts about when a cheerleader falls during a stunt is that she usually takes a couple other people down with her! There's nothing you can do to avoid this mishap, and we promise you'll see it plenty more times throughout the rest of the list.

## Look Out!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-1515861919260.jpg) [The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) Cheerleaders are mostly associated with football, although other sports definitely have their own cheerleaders as well. Standing on the sidelines at these games means sometimes getting pulled into the action! She was certainly surprised when she got knocked over by a big football player! Luckily neither of them were seriously hurt.

## Don't Cry!

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) She looks like she was thinking about something upsetting when she got tossed into the air! It looks as though she's about to burst into tears on the way down! Hopefully, that was just the way her face looked, because as we'll see on the rest of the entries, cheerleaders make some seriously hilarious faces.

## So Flattering

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4-1515862057589.jpg) 

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) This has to be one of the most hilariously ridiculous cheerleading fail faces we've ever seen. You can't make a face like this if you're just sitting around. You really have to be in the moment to pull off a facial expression as outrageous as this one.

## They're Coming For You

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-1515862085278.jpg) 

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) Cheerleaders have to be full of expression in order to really liven up their routine and put the "cheer" in their name. Sometimes, that means that cheerleaders get a little carried away with just how "cheerful" their expressions are! Imagine these girls coming at you when you're walking down a street alone! That's still a better option than some of the scary faces on the list.

## What Kind Of Move Is This?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6-1515862110951.jpg) 

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) We're not sure exactly what's wrong here, or what the fail might be. One thing that we know for certain, however, is that this can't be right! Male cheerleaders are usually used to help assist the girls in their routines and lift them up high into the air. So what exactly is going on here?

## Nice View

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7-1515862137626.jpg) 

[The Sportster](https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-most-embarrassing-cheerleader-photos-ever-taken/) When performing routines, flips, cheers, and stunts, cheerleaders have to get really close sometimes. It's important to be comfortable and trust the person that's tossing you around. Sometimes, however, you get a little too close to the person you're tossing around in the air, like this guy.

## This Is Why We Use Mats

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8-1515862171838.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) Imagine how brutal some of the face injuries would be if cheerleaders didn't use mats! Although they have a cushion padding to fall back on, that doesn't mean it still doesn't totally hurt to get your face smashed into the ground. Don't worry, this isn't the last time you'll see this on the list.

## When You See Your Crush Talking To Another Girl In The Audience

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9-1515862204677.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) Her expression is literally perfect in this picture and we can't stop laughing. She looks like she saw something mid-flip in the audience that really threw her off! Regardless of what she might have seen, she still looks like she has a pretty good form and might make the landing!

## Just Smelling The Grass

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10-1515862366047.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) This poor girl looks like she decided to take a break fromÂ cheer practice to get a nice whiff of the freshly cut grass. Do you think she had a grass stain on her teeth after she recovered? We'd love a picture of that part of this cheerleading fail!

## Who's Got The Best Face In This One?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11-1515862403357.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) You'd think with all those girls standing below someone during a lift, you'd be able to catch them easier and have fewer falls! It can be hard to work and coordinate with other people, however, so chaos often ensues. The hardest part about seeing this picture is trying to decide who has the best face.

## What Could They Have Seen?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12-1515862442504.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/14-hilarious-cheerleader-faces/84558124/) Maybe it was laundry day for the two girls being lifted in this photograph and they had to make some questionable underwear choices. Whatever the two girls holding them saw, we don't want to know! Would you trust someone to lift you up if they had made this face before?

## Don't Worry, They'll Catch You! Maybe...

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/13-1515862474447.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) This girl does not look like she trusts whoever is below her. We don't blame you! After seeing what could go wrong so far on this list, we wouldn't trust most cheerleaders to hold us up either. This girl had nothing to worry about compared to some of the other cheerleaders on the list, however.

## Were They Supposed To Have Their Tongues Out?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14-1515862516612.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) Even though the girl in the back is out of focus, you can still tell that they both have their tongues sticking out. Do you think that this was part of their routine, or is that just something that happens to cheerleaders as they stretch their leg straight up in the air?

## Look Out Below!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-1515862553728.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/14-hilarious-cheerleader-faces/84558124/) If you Photoshopped this girl out of the picture and just isolated her, removing everything else, you could make some hilarious memes out of it! She was caught at just the perfect moment during her routine and ended up looking completely bizarre. Caption this while you're here, will you?

## You Had One Job

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/16-1515862616122.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) This girl didn't have to be lifted in the air and tossed around to totally fail. We get that the stunts and coordination can be really hard and require a lot of practice. This one was just a complete fail from the beginning, however. Maybe she was trying to say OG. Backwards and upside down...

## This Little Cheerleader Is Already Nailing It

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/17-1515862664617.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) The little blonde girl is really going to be a great cheerleader one day. As we've seen on the list already, making ridiculous faces is crucial to being a good cheerleader! She's certainly nailing that part so far! Let's just hope she doesn't end up like the girls on the rest of the list.

## Pull That Leg Any Harder And Who Knows What Face She'll Make

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18-1515862703471.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/14-hilarious-cheerleader-faces/84558124/) Like we said earlier, maybe pulling your leg super hard like these cheerleaders can cause you to make a ridiculous face. On top of the already difficult position, she also has to pretend like she's pointing a gun for whatever reason. If she pulls that leg any harder or adds any other stunt to this move, we're scared of what her face might look like.

## They Knew What Was Coming

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19-1515862756056.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/cheerleaders-fails/84442947/) The young cheerleaders on the ground in this picture clearly knew something bad was about to happen. It's hilarious that their expressions were able to be captured so perfectly right at this very moment! Hopefully whatever did come of the cheerleader in the air wasn't too cringe-inducing!

## Surprise!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20-1515862792255.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/14-hilarious-cheerleader-faces/84558124/) If you take the cheerleading clues out of this picture, you could really have some fun with it. Her facial expression could mean just about anything, we'd love to see some creative captions on this. To add to that, she's also positioned right in between someone's legs! We'll be laughing about this one for a while.
