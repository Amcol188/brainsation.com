[ThePinsta](http://www.thepinsta.com/dog-kills-woman_X9z%7CImKTl%7CzIGt%7CGaqsydR*%7CS6bs*ZWS4bqEBG55gow/) Animal attacks are a common cause of either human injuries or fatalities. In the U.S. alone, up to five million people are attacked by dogs and cats each year, with the frequency of animal attacks varying depending on geographical location. In the U.S., an individual is more likely to be killed by domesticated animals than they are to die from being hit by lighting. When agitated, hungry, or scared, animals go back to their true nature - the instinct to survive no matter the cause. Here is a look of some of the 20 most insane animal attacks.
