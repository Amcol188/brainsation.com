and expensive way to ruin the environment around us and just means that resources are diverted away from more important matters just to tidy the place up. However, at its finest, vandalism can also be high art and truly capture some insight into the human condition. These pics don't show that kind of vandalism, but it is the kind that makes you laugh when you see it. These vandals weren't out to change the world, they were just out to make your day brighter! Click to the next slide to see what we mean.

When your framework's a mess, you don't panic, you send for graffiti Bruce Lee. Then nobody's pride is dented, apart from the person who owns that frame.

We love this, but you have to admit it might be disconcerting if you were driving home late at night to find the walls staring back at you.

Sadly, in this case, these guys can keep pushing hard for as long as they like. These lines are going nowhere, but they are entertaining.

Spiderman said it in 1960. We assume that's because the cracks were already beginning to show in the weird web that he wove for himself. Watch out for another awesome cartoon character making an almost appearance in this list soon.

Something's been grating on someone's nerves, because they decided to paint a skeleton over it. Maybe it's because it rattles at night?

You don't have to be a great artist to make a difference with graffiti, you can always be a great humorist instead. This says it all and it does so brilliantly.

If you find yourself ready to down a couple of bottles of wine in the day, don't be surprised when somebody's ready for a little boxing when you get home.

If it's not Michelangelo it could be Donatello. This shows great awareness of what made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles possible. Pizza. Now we want some too. Can you guess what other pop culture cameos we've got coming up? Stay tuned to find out.

These kids are braver than we are. There's no way on earth we'd get near that house's mouth. It's huge and those eyes say "hungry."

## Psychotic Stick Man

There you are on you way home from a stick lunch break and then there's a crazy stickman trying to end your day. What is the world coming to?

What's most peculiar about this is that while this street VCR is very well done, there's a whole Netflix generation out there who won't have a clue what this is.

## This Is Not The Droid That You Are Looking For

You can tell because this droid is in fact knitted out of wool and then placed over a concrete bollard. A brighter way to deal with traffic, but no use when it comes to saving the galaxy. There's another _Star Wars_ favorite joining us soon, don't go away.

Do cabinets feel fear? This graffiti raises an existential question whilst bringing a smile to the viewer. Also, it has cuddles which are always good.

We hope that nobody was stood over him when he started to tell lies, that could have been very awkward, indeed. Also, it wouldn't be right in the next Disney movie about him either.

You know because he's "shot through the heart!" No? Nevermind we thought that might have hooked you, it's certainly hooked him. This is extra pun-ishment.

We imagine that Master Yoda would say something like this to the policeman, "Train yourself to let go of everything that you fear to lose." You won't believe what's happened to Spongebob though, coming up next.

"I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's Spongebob!" Enough said.

And a close look into this fine chap's windows will reveal a landscape with devils, burning fire and pitchforks by the appearance of things.

This graffiti artist's only purpose in life is to raise the blood pressure of every single person who walks by, and sadly, it works. You'll be followed by doubt all day now.

## The Money Burger

You what? We know, it makes very little sense to us either. However, it is a very good drawing of a burger with money in it and that made us smile and be confused at the same time.
