Although the human body is incredibly resilient in terms of what it can endure, most people aren't very flexible. Mastering the art of contortion takes a lot of training and good, rubbery genes.  Many factors are taken into account when establishing personal flexibility: joint structure, ligaments, tendons, muscles, skin, tissue injury, fat (or adipose) tissue, body temperature, activity level, age and sex all influence an individual's range of motion about a joint. The following people all scored perfectly in each of these departments...
