Although Jerry Hall was one of the most successful models of the 1970s, it was her marriage to Mick Jagger that catapulted her into the upper echelons of fame and fortune.

The couple’s daughter, Georgia May Jagger, seems to intent to follow in her mother’s Gucci-clad footsteps.

Having been signed by Independent Models at age 16, Georgia May has appeared in dozens of campaigns for well-known brands, such as Miu Miu and Chanel.
