After two years of trying to determine what it was that was drifting above the clouds off the coast of Chile on November 11 of 2014, that nation's version of our Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the CEFAA, has recently released nearly ten minutes of footage of an apparent UFO that has left Chilean officials at a loss to explain, reports [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/groundbreaking-ufo-video-just-released-from-chilean_us_586d37bce4b014e7c72ee56b).

On the date mentioned above, two Chilean naval aviators flying an Airbus Cougar AS-532 helicopter on a routine daytime patrol, spotted what they later described as a white, semi-oval shaped "flat, elongated structure that had two thermal spotlights like discharges that did not coincide with the axel of motion". The object was 35 to 40 miles away from the helicopter and at about the same altitude.

**Contact** First spotted by a FLIR (forward-looking infrared) device at 1:52 pm, the object was noted as traveling slowly west/northwest. The naval team quickly contacted regional air traffic control to verify the object but were told there was no radar signal for the object described. The CEFAA, which is supervised by the Chilean military, also ruled out other armed forces aircraft as being in the area. Even the Cougar's targeting system and onboard radar failed to pick up the UFO.

With these tools failing, the pilots attempted to hail the craft using a multi-language civilian radio bandwidth dedicated for such purposes. There was no response. The object was followed visually for almost ten minutes before it disappeared into some clouds about the same time the naval team was called back to base. **Strange Behavior** At just over eight minutes into the surveillance, the UFO emits a plume of intensely hot gas or aerosol into the air, leaving behind a hot contrail that blended into the clouds nearby, but was noticeably brighter. The emission lasts for around thirty seconds.

Over a minute later, the craft lets loose another hot contrail and then reportedly moves to concealment in the clouds. Well-known astrophysicist Luis Barrera "noted that when the first ejection event occurred, the material came out from two different parts of the object and then joined in space making one wake. The first was massive and dark in the IR (meaning very hot); the second lighter and semi-transparent."

Upon returning to base, the crew immediately handed over the video of the incident to their superiors, who then gave it to the CEFAA. The pilots were interviewed by the Director of the CEFAA, General Ricardo Bermudez, and a nuclear chemist named Mario Avila. “I was very impressed by these witnesses,” Avila is quoted as saying, "They were highly trained professionals with many years experience, and they were absolutely certain that they could not explain what they saw.”

**Process of Elimination** “We do not know what it was," General Bermudez has said, "but we do know what it was not.” Thanks to the efforts of " astrophysicist Barrera; an image expert from the Air Force photogrammetric service...Luis Salazar, Chilean Air Force meteorologist; a DGAC aeronautic engineer; a digital images specialist from the National Museum of Aeronautics and Space in Santiago; and Mario Avila, a nuclear chemist" all aspects of the encounter were analyzed and the team was able to eliminate commercial or known military aircraft, drones, space junk, weather balloons, a hoax, meteorological phenomenon or other natural occurrences from the list of suspects.

While helpful, it still did not answer the question that CEFAA international affairs director, Jose Lay, said perplexed the investigatory team: “What the hell is that?” Check out the video below and decide for yourself what you think it was.
