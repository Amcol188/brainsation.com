The daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright has created a successful modeling career, but not before going through a few hardships.

Dylan attended Marin Academy and dropped out of the University of Southern California after one semester. Her parents’ divorce was finalized in 2010.

And before modeling, Penn had worked delivering pizzas, as a waitress, and as a freelance screenplay editor.

She also worked in New York City as a restaurant hostess and an intern at an advertising agency.

In April of 2014, Penn posed for a partially nude cover and interior layout in the seventh issue of the erotica magazine Treats.

Curiously, her father said that he had “always loved Dylan’s black-and-white nudes.”

Uh, moving right along…

Next we’ve got “The Hoff” and his daughter Haley…
