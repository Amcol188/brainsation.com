With the 2018 Olympics upon us, you might find yourself flipping through photos of hot female athletes -- so, we've saved you some trouble. While all athletes are in shape (it's kind of a requirement of the job) some of them are just downright sexy. For many of them, time off from training means there's plenty of time to model, and plenty of these ladies do just that. You may recognize a number of these sexy athletes from their various ads and photoshoots in which they aren't at all shy about showing off their incredible bodies. Check out 20 of the hottest Olympians to ever compete in the Games.

## Jaqueline Carvalho, Brazil

The American diver lives in Texas with her family, and her sister, Kara, is also a skilled diver. Before Kassidy started diving, she was a model, which comes as no surprise -- she certainly has the looks (and the body) to be a successful model. Up next is Great Britain's "beauty and brains" athlete.

## Maddie Hinch, Great Britain

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14_opt-1515552075381.jpg) 

[Instagram/Maddie Hinch](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdnePvmnLMA/?hl=en&taken-by=maddiehinch) Maddie is her name and field hockey is her game (we wonder how many times she has actually heard that one). Maddie isn't just a talented athlete -- she's the whole package, beauty and brains, as they say. She obtained a degree in Sport & Exercise Science from Loughborough University -- that just makes her hotter, doesn't it?

## Pernille Blume, Denmark

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/16_opt-1515552617925.jpg)

The 23-year-old was made to swim, it seems, and her body proves it. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, becoming the gold medal champion in women's 50 meter freestyle that year. From Denmark, we travel to Italy to meet one of the European country's hottest athletes.

[Instagram/Michelle Jenneke](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXNcxbIHfLx/?hl=en&taken-by=mjenneke93) A quick Google search of Michelle Jenneke will kick back a result that describes her as an "Australian model" -- which she is. But she is also a runner. The 24-year-old was in Rio for the 2016 Summer Games. And, last but not least, we meet a stunning brunette who is part of Russia's curling team.

## Anna Sidorova, Russia

[Instagram/Anna Sidorova](https://www.instagram.com/p/BW8QBbOgCdg/?hl=en&taken-by=curlme_anna) Curling is some kind of phenomenon that takes the world by storm every time the Winter Olympics roll around. Russia's Anna Sidorova is also a phenomenon that people can't seem to get enough of. Maybe you can't see her hot bod under all of her winter clothes, but we're here to assure you that Sidorova is on fire.
