On January 13, 2012, a cruise ship hit an underwater rock formation off the coast of Tuscany. The _Costa Concordia_ capsized, killing a total of 31 passengers and one crew member. In 2016, a photographer by the name of Jonathan Danko Kielkowski illegally swam out to the ship in order to take some photos. Here is a look at some of the amazing, eerie footage that he was able to capture once he climbed onboard...

## The Uprighted Ship

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/8tGM4) The once-luxury cruise ship was completely water damaged. Everything on the boat was ruined or washed away. This photo shows the boat upright following the accident. The next several photos are simply incredible to look at...

## Life Vests

These life vests are stacked, unused, mostly in their rows where they were stored. This photo is quite sad, as passengers were unable to get to these potentially life-saving items.

## Clothing & Linens

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) Passengers and crews were forced to abandon their belongings, all of which were damaged as the ship sank. It's hard to believe that this was once a beautiful cabin.

## Desolate Hallway

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/7-1499393717199.jpg)

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) Once bustling with happy travelers, this hallway was left completely desolate, with only horrifying memories of passengers running for their lives, not knowing what was going to happen next.

## It Looks Like A Wooden Ship

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1-1499392561163.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) After the boat was resurfaced, it appeared as though it was a man-made ship, created using planks of wood. That's hardly close to what it once looked like, docked and ready to take travelers on vacation. The next photos will blow your mind...

## Eerie Elevator Shafts

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14-1499392899031.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) These elevator shafts look like they are from the set of a movie. The green accents almost make the picture look beautiful, in a very strange way.

## Common Area

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/15-1499393042448.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This common area, which looks like the front of the elevator shafts, shows just how much damage the ship suffered after hitting that rock formation and sinking.

## An Elevator Made Of Sea Glass

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/10-1499393754689.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) The glass on the front of this elevator was in the water for so long that it has a sea glass appearance. It's hard to believe that it once transported passengers to their cabins.

## A Destroyed Cabin

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5-1499393921499.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) If you've ever been on a cruise, you are probably used to seeing very nice, clean cabins, where you retreat at the end of a long day.

## The Buffet

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/8-1499393938758.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) A place where passengers gathered to enjoy a meal and chat with fellow travelers has quite the feeling of emptiness now. These next few photos will make you feel the same way...

## Smashed Plates

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9-1499393950641.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) As the ship turned on its side and sank, things fell out of cabinets and off of shelves. What is left is a reminder of the incredible amount of damage that was done.

## Ruined Furniture

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/12-1499393965962.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This photo appears to show a decent amount of damaged furniture. It looks like there's a couch of some sort flipped upside down and thrown over the top of other items that were in this particular space.

## A Place To Rest Your Head

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/11-1499393979987.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This bed was supposed to be a place for weary explorers to rest before heading out on their next adventure. This next photo looks like it is part of a haunted house...

## A Creepy Chandelier

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/13-1499393992303.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) Another photo that is almost eerily beautiful. The chandelier and the upside down chairs almost look like a painting that someone would hang in their home.

## Splashes Of Color

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14-1499394003654.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) Poker chips were scattered all over the ship's casino floor. The piles of different colors were once used by passengers enjoying a night of gambling.

## Art Becomes Art

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/15-1499394017778.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This is another photo that looks like a piece of artwork. The green accents almost cause you to forget that you're looking at a shipwreck.

## Utter Destruction

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16-1499394032298.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This photo shows just how much destruction was caused in the accident. This almost looks like a complete home demolition amidst a renovation. The next photo looks very similar...

## Look At The Lights

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17-1499394048248.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) The lights on the ceiling in this photo managed to stay in their place, but they have been completely destroyed, the glass almost looks like it's dripping—as if they melted.

## A Brown Hallway

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18-1499394064431.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) Here is another hallway that once may have been filled with passengers and/or crew members. Some of those passengers may have been heading to an onboard bar, which you can see in the next picture.

## The Ship's Bar

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19-1499394172883.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This was once a place where travelers would enjoy a beverage and chat with other passengers, getting to know one another and share stories of their trips.

## Slot Machines

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/20-1499394193650.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) A casino is a very popular spot on cruise ships. People often head down to play slot machines or table games at night or when the ship is at sea.

## Abandoned Luggage

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21-1499394210236.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) There is something tragically lonely about seeing these abandoned suitcases in the hall without an owner to carry them off the boat. This next photo is also very lonely looking...

## A Place To Socialize

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22-1499394225732.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This round bar may have been a hotspot for travelers, but now there isn't anyone that would want to sit around it and socialize.

## The Theater

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/23-1499394242285.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) As artistic as the theater might be, this photo is one of the most haunting out of the bunch. Another really eerie shot captured by Kielkowski.

## The Piano Bar

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24-1499394268805.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) A baby grand piano and chess table are clearly visible in this photo. It's hard to believe that this room is still put together, relatively speaking, given the destruction in other areas.

## Water In The Hallway

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/25-1499394283063.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) These walls may have once been covered in fancy wallpaper and the floor in a beautifully patterned rug. Not unlike what you'll see in the next photo...

## An Emerald Staircase

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/26-1499394307021.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) This staircase was once a centerpiece on the _Costa Concordia_. It was more than likely a popular spot to take photos, too. It looks much different now.

## The Control Room

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/27-1499394326297.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) It goes without saying that all of the mechanical elements on the ship were damaged well beyond repair. The flooring in this picture is completely gutted.

## Weak Stairs

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/28-1499394341209.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) These staircases were once filled with passengers going up and down, trying to get to their next destination on the boat. They probably can't hold any weight now.

## The Atrium

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29-1499394354475.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/XDw5J) The artwork in this part of the ship doesn't appear damaged, which is remarkable. It makes it hard to believe the destruction seen in most of the other photos in this slideshow.
