Lovers of HBO’s TV series Game of Thrones who have read George R.R Martin’s book _A Song of Ice and Fire_ upon which the series is based, acknowledge the fact that key differences exist between the characters in the book and TV series. Naturally, the nature of the medium allows some changes to take place as we transit from the books to a television show. Even as the show continues to develop through season 7, the differences between the book version and the show become more pronounced. In this article, we compile the key differences between characters as portrayed in the "Game of Thrones" book and how they appear on the show.

He is the bastard son of Ned Stark. He is despised by his stepmother and is sent to be part of the Night's watch group at a tender age. According to the description in the book, John resembles a Stark more than any of his step brothers. He has a long face, dark hair, and gray eyes. Although John Snow in the movies has all the other traits, the aspect of gray eyes is missing, and somehow, his face isn't long.

## Arya Stark

[**BoreBurn**](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/08/Arya-Stark-640x426.jpg)

Arya is the third born in the family of Ned and Catelyn Stark. In the Series, she is portrayed as a naughty girl who can't be tamed. She prefers being more like a man than a lady- the reason why she loves running around and fighting. In the book, she is described as a small and skinny girl who resembles her brother John Snow. She has dark hair, long face with gray eyes.

## Sam Tarly

John Snow's most loyal friend and a brother of the Night's watch. He is rejected by his father who is a powerful Lord since he preferred reading to hunting and fighting. His weight is his defining feature. He has pale eyes and dark hair as well. John Bradley matches this description regarding weight, but the beard isn't mentioned anywhere in the book.

## Sansa Stark

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dfa139937256d94821b4bc5c9374b0ad8ca78c97_hq-1-300x300.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dfa139937256d94821b4bc5c9374b0ad8ca78c97_hq-1.jpg)

Sansa is a sister to Arya and the eldest daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark. George Martin describes Sansa as the complete replica of her mother. She has thick auburn hair with dark blue eyes. She is tall and beautiful. The matching of Sophie Turner and Sansa Stark is perfect because she has all the traits of Sansa as described in the book.

## Melisandre

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/7638eee4c8e04803cc6b4e9502a38ac6-1-300x188.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/7638eee4c8e04803cc6b4e9502a38ac6-1.jpg)

[**Dorkly**](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/7638eee4c8e04803cc6b4e9502a38ac6.jpg)

She is the priestess of the Lord of Light giving birth to a shadow baby at one point. In the book, Melisandre is known to use her beauty to win people’s hearts. Her long hair copper hair and her pale skin compliment her beauty well. She has an amazing figure with a narrow waist. Carice Van Houten is a perfect match.

## Daenerys Targaryen

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/how-do-hbo-s-got-characters-compare-to-their-descriptions-in-the-books-300x186.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/how-do-hbo-s-got-characters-compare-to-their-descriptions-in-the-books.jpg)

[**MoviePilot**](https://images.moviepilot.com/images/c_limit,q_auto:good,w_600/eyg8uqal1grjului4hc9/how-do-hbo-s-got-characters-compare-to-their-descriptions-in-the-books.jpg)

She is commonly referred to as the Queen of the Dragons and the Breaker of Chains. Probably, the only surviving member of the family Targaryen who is on a mission to take over the Kings Landing. Her beauty in the book is described as stunning. She is portrayed with purple eyes and silver-blonde hair. In the movie, Daenerys possesses all the other traits, but she lacks the purple eyes.

## Yara Greyjoy

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Yara-Greyjoy-640x426-1-300x200.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Yara-Greyjoy-640x426-1.jpg) 

The sister of Theon Greyjoy who is the preferred heir to the throne. A skilled ship captain and a commander of a loyal army. She is known as Asha in the book, and she is greatly admired by many due to her stunning beauty. She has a big nose and black and cropped hair. Probably the most mismatched character in the TV series. The director gets everything wrong about her starting from the name.

## Tyrion Lannister

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NuzQTT0ji8dl-1-300x186.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NuzQTT0ji8dl-1.jpg)

[Zimbio](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NuzQTT0ji8dl.jpg)

He is rejected by his father-Tywin Lannister due to his dwarfism. He was accused of murdering Joffrey which forced him to move away from Westeros. In the book, he is described as having mismatched eyes with one green eye and a black one. His hair is a mixture of pale blonde and black hair. The only common thing between Tyrion Lannister in the book and Peter Dinklage is probably the dwarfism.

## Ramsey Bolton

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mUo1M0Tle8I-1-300x179.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mUo1M0Tle8I-1.jpg)

[**Explosion**](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mUo1M0Tle8I.jpg)

The bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton. Ramsey is described as an ugly man in the book with sloped shoulders. His skin is described as pink and blotchy. He has dark hair, a small mouth, and a broad nose. In the TV show, Iwan Rheon isn't as ugly as the Ramsy described in the book.

## Joffrey Baratheon

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1c944f27a36f98f36d50ecb27dce5e50-1-300x170.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1c944f27a36f98f36d50ecb27dce5e50-1.jpg)

[**Dorkly**](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1c944f27a36f98f36d50ecb27dce5e50.jpg)

He is the product of a blood relationship between Cersei and her Younger Brother Jaime Lannister. George Martin describes him as a taller young boy. In the book, he is taller than Robb and John Snow although he is still young. He has green eyes just like the other Lannisters, golden curls, and pouty lips. The show doesn't have a quite good match.

## Cersei Lannister

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/139-1-300x193.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/139-1.jpg)

[**GalleryRoulette**](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/139.jpg)

She is the eldest child of Tywin Lannister. In the book, Cersei is described as the most beautiful girl in the seven kingdoms. She possesses the classic House Lannister traits of green eyes, blonde hair, and fair skin. Her attributes change as the story progresses due to her fondness of drinking wine and her motherhood status.

## Jaime Lannister

[![](http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a9e2b765584de8df8b40fa7d8a9434e2-300x169.jpg)](http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a9e2b765584de8df8b40fa7d8a9434e2.jpg)

[**LadBible**](http://newsattorneys.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a9e2b765584de8df8b40fa7d8a9434e2.jpg)

Jaime is Tywin's most trusted son and a great fighter. He is appointed as the king's guard at a tender age. He portrays all the classical looks of a real Lannister- green eye, handsome and golden hair. In the show, Nikolaj Caster seems to be a perfect match for this character.

## Varys

He is the king's spymaster. Although he grew outside the seven kingdoms, he has become a force no one can afford to ignore. He is described as plump with a bald and a powdered face. George RR Martin describes him as a master of disguise and an effeminate. Conleth Hill is a pretty good match for this character in the TV show.

## Littlefinger

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/littlefingergallery-large_transqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8-1-300x187.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/littlefingergallery-large_transqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8-1.jpg)

Petr Baelish is the employer of the many Westeros sex workers. He is always pulling more than one string in the seven kingdoms, and nobody seems to realize it. In the book, he gets his name, Littlefinger, from his height. He has a small pointed beard and dark hair with few flecks of gray. Aidan Gillen in the TV series is a pretty good match of Lord Baelish.

## Robb Stark

[![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0b2c4d82445e6c68a6acf2f2ed016115-1-300x257.jpg)](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0b2c4d82445e6c68a6acf2f2ed016115-1.jpg)

[**dailyTop**](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0b2c4d82445e6c68a6acf2f2ed016115.jpg)

He is the first born son of Ned Stark and the rightful heir of his father. He proclaims himself the King in the North and tries to go against King Joffrey the moment when his father was detained for treason. In the book, he is described to have deep blue eyes and a thick shoulder-length auburn hair. Richard Madden is not a good match for Robb Stark. His hair isn't short, and the eyes aren't deep blue either.
