At 53, Rob Lowe is old enough to be his son John’s grandfather, and yet, the handsome duo can frequently be seen working out together.

“There comes a time in everybody’s life when they have to set off and make a name for themselves,” the 21-year-old recently told Ellen Degeneres.

And apparently, John Owen Lowe is ready for the spotlight with his new A&E show, The Lowe Files.

But this isn’t John’s first foray into show business.

John Owen starred on his dear old dad’s show The Grinder as Joel Zadak from 2015 to 2016.

He and his older brother, Matthew, have also made numerous appearances on daytime talk shows and entertainment programs including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The View, and Entertainment Tonight.

Following his debut on The Grinder, John confirmed to the Sioux City Journal that he planned on following in his father’s footsteps, saying, “At first it was just a fun thing to try, but now I’m enjoying it so much I think I’ve got the bug.”
