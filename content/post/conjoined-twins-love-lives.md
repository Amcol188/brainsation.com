### The Hensel twins have always been notoriously coy about discussing details of their love lives with the public. However, Brittany did share one detail recently thatÂ ruffled her sister Abby's feathers.

"Let's just say that we've both had our fair share of kisses over the years," said Brittany. "There's no need to fight over something there's plenty of in the first place."

"Oh my god," Abby chimed in. "We usually don't talk about stuff like this, but Brittany likes to shock. It's true, though."

So apparently the girls are doing quite alright! It's wonderful to see these adorable women overcome steep odds, enjoy life, and share their kindness and charisma with the rest of us.

They are truly a blessing!
