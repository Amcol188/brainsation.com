Although Steve Irwin shuffled off this mortal coil much too soon, he managed to leave a lasting mark on this world, with his gorgeous daughter intent on following in his footsteps.

But Binidi isn’t the only child of Steve and Terri Irwin.

Her younger brother is Robert Irwin, a television personality and photographer.

Bindi has been involved in acting, singing, dancing, rapping, game show hosting, and has created two instructional fitness DVDs.

She is also known for winning season 21 of Dancing with the Stars.

And next we’ve got the fabulous son of basketball legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson…
