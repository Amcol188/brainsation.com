You might be the best photographer there is out there but sometimes, you don’t have to be the best to take a perfect photo. You just need to be at the right place in the right moment. It will not matter if you take it with a phone or a very good camera; you just need to be passionate about what you do. Most of the time, you won’t even notice you took an awesome photo till you sit down to look at them.

## This baby must be proud of that booty!

The photo must have been taken with intentions? The face is too tiny compared to the body. Or is it that the body grew and forgot the head?  Whatever it is, that baby has some fine legs.  I wonder what it's going to look like when it gets older?

## Look What I Found!

[embracerandom](http://embracerandom.com/page/2/) So I really want to know a couple things about this photo.  How they got this idea?  Is that the moon or the sun?  But mainly, how did that girl get so far out into the desert in her high heels?  I mean, that is some serious terrain they are on.  Does not seem ideal.

## Say Cheese!

[tuxboard](https://www.tuxboard.com/photos-prises-au-bon-moment-3/pile-bon-moment-2/) "OMG, this one is going to be so cute on instagram!"  Not only is their picture ruined (or made more awesome?) but they are in for a quick surprise is half a second.  They about to be all wet.

## Look Closely

[michaelspingler](http://michelspingler.wixsite.com/photography/roland-garros) Uhhh, hey Serena, maybe you should pick a different color undershorts.  At first glance it looks like a full moon is out during the day, but upon closer examination, you can see they are just brown undershorts.  Wonder if she is just trolling us on purpose?

## Hey Dog, Close them legs!

[loopfyblog](https://loopfyblog.com/2017/01/14/amazingly-dirty-photos-you-have-to-see/) At first, I was like girl you need to tone it down a bit.  But then I realized her furry friend, was actually her furry friend.

## When You See It!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pic-13-Copy.jpg) 

[scoopwhoop](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/humor/badly-timed-photos/#.spqo0pakm) Hey! Get your mind out of the gutter! No those aren't huge knockers! They are her elbows!

## They Learn Young

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kid-Boobs.jpg)

[taringa](https://www.taringa.net/posts/imagenes/19668700/Momentos-perfectamente-calculados-pasale-y-veras.html) Now here is a kid who knows what he wants.  He is way ahead of his age on this one.  He is going to love college!

## When You See It! Part 2

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unintentionally-sexual-photos-8-Copy-Copy.jpg)

[newmoney](http://www.newmoney.gr/diethni/237775-deite-ti-ginetai-an-mia-fotografia-bgei-tin-katallili-stigmi) Close them legs girl! Oh wait...carry on.

## Hey, Put Some Underwear On!

## ![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg)

[listabuzz](http://listabuzz.com/amazingly-dirty-photos/) For a minute the crowd really thought they got more than they paid for.  Maybe you should get some different colored compression shorts?

## Snowboarder walks on the moon

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/204711082.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed2/204711082.jpg) First of all, imagine walking on the moon! It is amazing right? But being able to capture that moment is even more amazing given that the moon seems quite small.

## Former president Obama captured holding the sun.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/863294872.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed3/863294872.jpg)

Surprised? Well, he is not literally holding the sun but imagine what a good story that is. The sun is right in the palm of his hands till the, president Donald Trump blew it up.

## Who hasn’t experienced this once in a while?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1949884.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed3/1949884.jpg)

This is funny right? But who hasn’t been in this position especially on a Monday morning after a long weekend? To make the matters worse, you are called in a for a meeting even before you grab some coffee.

## Now, this is what we call a red carpet fall

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/12/jasonderulofalling-fb-420x453.jpg)

[PressCDN](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/12/jasonderulofalling-fb-420x453.jpg)

Apologies to Jason Darulo but seriously, this is so hilarious having to come all the way only to fall at the red carpet right?

## What are you doing?

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/12/subwayshade-fb-545x453.jpg)

[PressCDN](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/12/subwayshade-fb-545x453.jpg)

Ever looked at someone and wondered what they are doing? Well, this photographer was able to capture the best side eye ever. Take a look and comment.

## When its dad’s time to babysit.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-89.jpg)

Diapers got to be changed right? Also, you got to be armed appropriately for the task ahead. Honestly, kudos to our dear mums.

## Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder

[BoredPanda](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-13.jpg)

The above photo could not be timed any better. It is just perfect. It was taken in the right angle and at the right time, with the water amazingly clinging to the dress as if cut from the same cloth.

## Where is the head?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/280718454.jpg)

It is hard to imagine how much training this guy had to undergo to get to this position. You could easily assume he is a headless gymnast.

## Is the moon being moved?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/482038603.jpg)

Is the crane being used to move the moon towards the right? Wow! What a good timing to take the photo.

## Are those horns above a church?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/295606563.jpg)

The horns are just above the church. Let’s equate the church to be good and the horns to be evil. Is evil going above the good or are the two meeting at one place?

## Did this movie actually pose to give room for the cat?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/365149114.jpg)

This lady seems to be asking the cat “what do you want now?” and the cat seems to be so busy enjoying the show to notice.

## Hmm…hard to decide given I want them all

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-26.jpg)

Why would I have to choose when I can eat all of them? Hmm… the look when you can hear nothing but hunger pangs.

## Who said alcohol should be taken in small amounts?

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-105.jpg)

This man looks like he is deep in his own world. It seems like it is so sweet to even open his eyes. Alcohol can make you forget even your own self.

## What is the size of your brain?

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-109.jpg)

You don’t need to be so big to be intelligent. You just have to be wise as well as have brains to get to where you need to be. This kid knows how to use his brains.

## Who is good at training?

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-100.jpg)

If you are a girl child, you are lucky. Your mother is right there to teach you and help you grow but if you are a boy, you better catch up and learn from your father. Hmm…

## I said I need trimming only

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-16.jpg)

Ever found yourself in this position? Regretting every decision you have made to a point you wish you were not born? Well, this girl probably felt the same way.

## This baby must be proud of that booty!

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-36.jpg)

The photo must have been taken with intentions? The face is too tiny compared to the body. Or is it that the body grew and forgot the head?

## The world is too complicated to comprehend

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-35.jpg)

She actually needs aerials to think better. The photographer must have been timing to capture this photo. She is just right before the street lights yet she seems to have aerials on top of her head right?

## She must be scared of her own selfie.

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-55.jpg)

That moment you take a selfie and once you look at it, you get scared of what you see only to realize that is you.

## I must have my Friday night no matter what!

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-1011.jpg)

The man seems to be having the time of his life. Clothes or no clothes, the party must go on. Life is too short to worry about small things like having clothes or wearing women’s shoes.
