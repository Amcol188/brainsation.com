Transgender people are making themselves known more and more. Transgender people have always been courageous; however, many are now also becoming famous for what they are doing and how they are doing it. Younger people are no longer accepting arbitrarily-imposed definitions of gender identity or sexual orientation. In general, they are much more fluid about these things. They realize that these personal feelings are truly up to each individual. Diversity is amazing. It is what makes human beings so interesting. Here is our list of twenty famous celebrities who are surprisingly transgender for all kinds of intriguing and wonderful reasons:
