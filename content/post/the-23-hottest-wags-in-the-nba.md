## Cody Horn (Kevin Love)

Cody Horn is a smoking hot actress and model who has appeared in blockbusters like 'Magic Mike' and TV's ' The Office.'  Kevin Love rised to fame in his college days at UCLA, and now plays alongside Lebron James om the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning the 2016 NBA Championship.  Nice pickup, Kev!

## Elaine Alden (Landry Fields)

Landry Fields isn't exactly what you would call a superstar, as he has bounced around so many teams, we can't even keep track of them anymore.  However, he pulled a superstar smoke.  Alden is a model that has appeared in shoots for 'Maxim' and 'GQ.'

## Michelle Game (Charlie Villanueva)

Charlie Villanueva is a long time NBA player who is probably most notably known for Kevin Garnett saying he 'looks like a cancer patient.'  He had a nice NBA career, but nothing to write home about.  His wife, however, is definitely something to write home about.  Game is a model that has appeared in a bunch of music videos for 50 Cent, Meek Mill, etc.  Well done, Charlie!

## Alex Reid (Andrew Wiggins)

Andrew Wiggins is a young, rising superstar in the NBA.  He went to Kansas for college ball, and from the looks of the picture that is where he met the fine Alex Reid.

## Hannah Stocking (Klay Thompson)

Ok, so they definitely are not still together, but we had to include this one because of the tweet war that happened.  Apparently Hannah caught Klay (one of the Splash Bros) in bed with another girl and decided to tweet it out to the world.  What's even funnier is that Andrew Bogut (Klay's former teammate got involved!)  Check out the picture for the tweets.

## Teyana Taylor (Iman Shumpert)

Teyana Taylor does a bit of everything.  She's an actress, model, dancer and singer.  Iman Shumpert is a defensive genius and HAIR GAWD.  Enough said.

## Kendra Shaw (Julius Randle)

Julius Randle was a much bigger star in college than he is now while playing for the Lakers.  He is still trying to find his way in the NBA.  He recently married his smoking hot college sweetheart, Kendra Shaw.

## Adriana Lima (Marko Jaric)

We're not exactly sure who Marko Jaric is, but we absolutely know who Adriana Lima is.  This has to be the most shocking couple on the list!

## Jeanette McCurdy (Andre Drummond)

Jeanette McCurdy got her start on the Disney Channel as a young girl, but recently made headlines when some scandalous photos of her leaked.  Andre Drummond is quite possibly the largest player in the NBA.  They win most hilarious size difference.

## Jessyka Janshel (James Harden)

James Harden is fresh off of dating Khloe Kardashian (and not a minute too soon, as recent reports say Khloe is pregnant with Tristan Thompson's kid).  He has gone from dating reality TV star to Instagram model.  Two of the most prestigious careers.

## Ayesha Curry (Steph Curry)

At this point, there should be little to no introduction needed for Ayesha Curry. She’s none other than reigning MVP Stephen Curry’s wife, who definitely knows how to stir the social media pot with her passionate and sometimes misguided commentary about the NBA – particularly on how the Warriors won/lost the latest game.

## Gabrielle Union (Dwayne Wade)

Before Steph and Ayesha made real-life NBA couples interesting again, the most buzz-worthy pairing around was that of Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union’s. Wade and Union have had their shares of ups and downs over the years, but they did end up tying the knot in 2014 and remain happily married to date.

## Juliet Richardson - Kyle Korver

There aren’t a lot of guys in the NBA that prefer edgier women, but Kyle Korver’s not one of them. Meet Juliet Richardson; Korver’s significant other who’s had her fair share of moments under the limelight herself. In 2005, Richardson released an infectious dance track titled [“Avalon”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi8H6UMxlv4) simply under her first name. The Philly native wasn’t able to fully capitalize on the success of “Avalon”, but she turned out alright considering that she’s now tied to a sharpshooting professional basketball player who looks a whole lot like Ashton Kutcher.

## Meghan Allen - Devin Harris

This list wouldn’t be complete without a bombshell from the world of adult entertainment, so leave it to point guard Devin Harris to fill in that void. For over three years, Harris has been married to the voluptuous Meghan Allen, who was crowned Cyber Playmate of the Month in January of 2008. Despite the story that the two first met at a Dallas nightclub, Meghan only had her eye on Devin, and the two have been together since that fateful evening of supposed debauchery.

## Natasha Sen-Fizdale (David Fizdale - Memphis Head Coach)

There’s no question that NBA players have the upper hand in dating the hottest women on the planet, but how about head coaches? Well, it’s about time we ask Memphis head coach David Fizdale what his secret is because his wife Natasha is a bona fide babe.

## Yvette Prieto (Michael Jordan)

Wanna know how to top a head coach’s sizzling significant other? Try checking that one owner of an NBA team who also happens to be the greatest basketball player to ever play the game. Everybody knows the name Michael Jordan, but not everyone knows the woman behind the GOAT. Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto happens to be that lucky girl. Or, we could even say that MJ is the lucky one in this scenario considering just how mesmerizing Yvette is.

## Amber Alvarez (Deandre Jordan)

There’s not much information out there on DeAndre Jordan’s girlfriend, Amber Alvarez. All we know is that she’s one of the finest models we’ve ever seen given just a handful of her snapshots online and that she’s quite the vocal women’s rights advocate.

[![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/09/Amber-Alvarez-240x300.jpg)](http://americancolumn.com/the-23-hottest-wags-in-the-nba/18)

## Amelia Vega (Al Horford)

Al Horford gave up on the Hawks and took his talents to Boston, so we’re still anticipating that he somehow ends his personal relationship to Amelia as well for guys like us to make a move on the Dominican damsel.

## Brittany Renner (Ben Simmons)

This pocket-sized fitness buff is no stranger to dating professional athletes, with her most infamous relationship being with African-American civil rights activist and part-time NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Brittney’s moved on from Kaep to another high-profile baller in Ben Simmons, who failed to log-in a minute of work in his rookie campaign due to a major foot injury.
