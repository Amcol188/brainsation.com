The precise setting of the variables that went in to making our universe the way it is are beyond belief. Just a smidgen change here and there and the constitution of the cosmos could change and possibly make life extinct.

 [Pixnio](https://pixnio.com/space/planet-earth-universe-galaxy) Take that fragility of this cosmic stasis and try to replicate it in a parallel universe the balance becomes even harder to achieve. Thanks to a pair of research papers that have been published in the 'Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society', it appears that one variable could be increased on hundreds of magnitudes in a parallell universe and it would not deter the formation of life-giving planets.

[Multiverse - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Multiverse.jpg) Working with a computer simulation program called Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments, an international team of scientists from England, Australia and the Netherlands experimented with how a parallel universe might look by slowly adjusting certain key 'ingredients', writes [Live Science.](https://www.livescience.com/62558-parallel-universe-aliens-survive-dark-energy.html) What they found is that increasing the amount of dark energy in the model universe by hundreds of orders of magnitude still allowed life to develop, but scientists don't know why that is.

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Multiverse-possible-orig.jpg) "Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise," study co-author Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia, said in a [statement](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/du-cam051018.php). "Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe." In our universe, dark energy constitutes 70 percent of all universal energy mass. Despite this large presence, we still don't know what dark energy is or why it exists. All we do know is that it is the prime mover in the expanding universe. Not only that, but as it grows the universe it also speeds that growth up as more dark energy fills the voids the growth creates in the fabric of spacetime.

[NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=pia20051) So how is it that our paltry share of dark energy, as compared to that of the hypothetical universes, can give birth to cosmic life just as well as if it had 300 times the amount of the mysterious force? "I think we should be looking for a new law of physics to explain this strange property of our Universe," co-author Richard Bower, a professor at Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology, said in the statement.
