Australia’s Outback has been less crowded the past eighty years since the believed extinction of the thylacine or Tasmanian Tiger. The strange looking beast was a large stripped dingo-looking marsupial who entered the pages of history in 1936, when the last of its kind died in a Washington, D.C. zoo. Recent headway made by scientists looking to resurrect the woolly mammoth, however, have given biologists hope that the Tiger can once more roam the rugged terrain of the Outback.

Thylacine Awareness Group/YouTube\[/caption\] [IFL Science](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/the-tasmanian-tiger-could-soon-be-brought-back-from-extinction/) reports that in the closing months of 2017, scientists from the University of Melbourne finished sequencing the entire genome of the thylacine. With the genetic blueprint complete, the team feels that it is ready to program the preserved remains of thirteen thylacine joeys and reanimate the extinct species.

Using the gene-programming process called CRSIPR, scientists say they will be able to ‘bridge the gap’ between the mammoth’s genome and that of modern day elephants. “What you have to do is take that elephant DNA and make all the changes you see in the mammoth genome on the elephant’s genetic blueprint. Basically, you’re just editing the \[elephant\] DNA to make it look like a mammoth,” Professor Andrew Pask, University of Melbourne, told news.com.au.

Proponents of the research express excitement, yet the fact that very few if any scientists are debating the merits of going against what may have been a case of natural selection should be of concern.
