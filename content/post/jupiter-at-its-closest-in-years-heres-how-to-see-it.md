Starting on May 8, our solar systems largest planet entered into an orbital phase that brings it the closest it comes in the course of its celestial trek.

That is because it will be ‘only’ 409 million miles from earth, 5 million miles closer than its last close pass in 2017. On May 8th, the planet was aligned directly opposite the sun, making it on the “exact opposite side of Earth to the sun.”

If you missed out on the 8th viewing, don’t sweat it. Jupiter will be in its ‘full complement’ for the rest of May before beginning its orbiting journey away from Earth. During this time viewers will be able to see the planet with their own eyes, but with binoculars or a telescope they will have a chance to view the planet and all of its moons. And for the lucky ones, earthbound gazers may also see the large storms on Jupiter, including the Great Red Spot.
