There’s no denying that Zoë won the genetic lottery with both of her startlingly good-looking parents. Having grown up to become a sought-after actress, she’s been burning up the silver screen in movies like X-Men: First Class and Mad Max: Fury Road.

Kravitz’s parents married in 1987 and divorced six years later when Zoë was five. She initially lived with her mother in Topanga Canyon, and then moved to Miami at age eleven to be with her father.

Aside from acting, Kravitz was the face of Vera Wang’s Princess fragrance in 2009, and has modeled for Venus Zine and Elle, among others.
