The daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright has created a successful modeling career, but not before going through a few hardships.

Dylan attended Marin Academy and dropped out of the University of Southern California after one semester. Her parents’ divorce was finalized in 2010.

And before modeling, Penn had worked delivering pizzas, as a waitress, and as a freelance screenplay editor.
