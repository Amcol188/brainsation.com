Unless you're one of the lucky few billionaires who can commute from home to office via helicopter, you probably, at some point during your work day, have to deal with traffic. Well, if one Elon Musk has his way, those present day traffic aggravations will soon be coming to an end.

Now, Musk is just months away from offering commuters the first maiden voyage of his subterranean shuttle system, writes the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-elon-musk-tunnel-20180510-story.html). On May 10, Musk went on Instagram to announce, "First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done. Pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months."

As usual, money talks. Musk was able to usher his project through the L.A. City Council in record breaking time and even secured environmental exemptions that cleared the work for constructing the 2.7-mile-long tunnel located 30 to 70 feet below ground. The Times writes, “The tunnel's proposed route runs parallel to Sepulveda Boulevard, starting at Pico Boulevard and running down to Washington Boulevard in Culver City. The tunnel entrance would be located in what is currently a lumber yard and welding area, the company has said.”

According to a promotional video released last year, cars would drive onto a platform near a street curb. The platform would then drop down into the tube and then shuttles the car through the tunnel. The video also shows that pedestrians and cyclists can use the system as well,
