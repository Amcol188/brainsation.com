Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the same may be said of luck. A twenty-year-old Colorado native named Dylan McWilliams may either be the most unlucky or luckiest man, reports [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/man-bitten-by-shark-previously-mauled-by-bear-and-bitten-by-a-snake-11342277).

On April 19, while enjoying a two week vacation to Hawaii, McWilliams was on his surfboard in the early morning waters of Shipwreck's Beach, 50 yards off of Poipu. The avid surfer and survival instructor was enjoying a beautiful morning when he suddenly felt something clamp down on one of his submerged legs. **In the Eye of a Tiger** The bite was a quick nibble in what was probably a 'test bite' used by some sharks to gauge the reaction of prey. Upon being bit, McWilliams recalls seeing what he said was a tiger shark and noticed something else alarming. "I was looking around and saw a bunch of blood. I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what."

Describing his return ashore as the most scariest part of the ordeal, McWilliams was met on land by a bystander who called paramedics. The injuries to his leg, consisting of deep teeth marks, were not life threatening.

Just seven months before, the young awoke at a Colorado campsite to find the back of his head in the mouth of 300-lb black bear. Only after poking the bear in the eye did the beast let go of the young man, who ran off to join his camping group.

[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/04/22/man-bitten-by-shark-bear-snake-in-less-than-4-years.html) quotes McWilliams as saying, "The bear grabbed the back of my head and started pulling me and I was fighting back as best as I could. It dropped me and stomped on me a little bit, and I was able to get back to the group and they scared it away." Miraculously, the incident only resulted in nine stitches to the back of his head.

Three-and-a-half years prior to this, while trekking in Utah, McWilliams received a glancing bite from a rattlesnake. The attack delivered just enough venom to make McWilliams ill, but it did not kill him like a full-on bite would have.

Interviewed by a local Hawaiian newspaper after the shark attack, McWilliams noted wryly, “I’m either really lucky or really unlucky.”
