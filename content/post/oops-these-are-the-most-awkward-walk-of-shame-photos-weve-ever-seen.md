[sickchirpse](http://www.sickchirpse.com/worst-walk-of-shame-ever/) Everyone likes to party now and then to let off some steam and get crazy with friends. What you have to remember when you're partying, however, is how you're planning to get home the next day! Not everyone knows exactly where they'll end up the night of a party, and the next day, they're forced to do the _Walk of Shame_. From the heels they're still wearing to the messy hair, you can tell these ladies got down with their bad selves last night, and who knows what kind of trouble they got into. You've probably seen people make the _Walk of Shame_ IRL once or twice, but these examples are easily the worst, most embarrassingÂ we've ever seen!

## Where Is She Going?

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Some might look at this photograph and think that she's just a girl showing off some leg while wearing an oversized sweatshirt. We can still see the look of disappointment on her face and some smudged makeup, however, so she's not fooling anyone. There are some more obvious walk of shamers on the list still.

## Those Shorts Tho

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) We at least _hope_ this is a walk of shamer, or else she needs to seriously reevaluate her outfit choice. Some people definitely have some questionable fashion choices, but this looks like a case of a girl trying to sneak home the next day. She's not the only one...

## You Could Have At Least Worn A Nicer Bra!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779740-1515610221702.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) This lady seriously has no shame when it comes to walking home the morning after. She couldn't even be bothered to put on whatever top she was wearing the night before! She could have at least chosen a nicer bra so as to not bring more attention to herself. Sadly, she's not the messiest one on the list...

## Where Could She Bee Going?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779734-1515610360667.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Let's give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she was on her way to a costume party. In the morning. Halloween is always the best time to catch walk of shamers the morning after. People tend to forget that they should bring a change of clothes along with their costume!

## Is That A Towel Around Her Waist?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779731.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Hey, compared to some of the other girls on the list, at least she tried to cover it up the next day! She almost got away with it too, but holding her big chunky heels is a dead giveaway that she was partying the night before. It's always carrying the heels that really gets the girls the next day. This towel could really come in handy to a girl coming up on the list.

## At Least They're Not Alone

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779745.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) We've spotted a wild squad of walk-of-shamers! Compared to the other girls on the list, at least these ladies have each other to lean on when they might feel a little embarrassed about walking home alone. Surprisingly, they won't be the only squad you'll see walking home together on this list.

## Their Face Says It All

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779743.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) When it comes to these two ladies, we don't even have to look at their bare feet or last night's party dresses to know they got caught on the walk home. Also, are they in the middle of nowhere? What club did they go to last night? It's the faces of these girls that really have us screaming.

## At Least The Guy Gave Her Some Clothes

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779742.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Finally, we see a girl on the list whose one-night stand had the decency to give her some of his sweats so she was spared the walk home in her tight dress. Unfortunately for her, this is also a dead giveaway that she did more than just drink and dance too much the night before. Don't worry, she's not the last on the list that had too much fun last night.

## Doesn't She Know Walking Barefoot Is Dangerous?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779728.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/)

This girl needs to put some real shoes on! Who knows what she might step in? She's probably not too concerned about that, as walking home in the shoes from last night would be much more painful. Luckily some of the other girls on the list have some more creative ways to avoid wearing their shoes from last night home.

## Get Her Coffee Quick!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779726.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Do you think once she takes that first sip of coffee she'll realize what she just wore inside? It's one thing to walk home the next day and have everyone on the street see what you're up to, but she had no shame when it came to walking into a restaurant. They have drive-thrus for a reason...

## At Least She Can Laugh At Herself

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779738-1515611210427.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) This girl clearly had a good night as she's still smiling on the way home! That's certainly better than some of the other girls on the list who can't even show their faces. If she were wearing some leggings instead of those short shorts, you might just think she was being a little extra in her shoe choice that day.

## She Knows She Got Busted

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779737.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) It looks like she ALMOST made it into her apartment building without getting caught, but at the last second, she realized someone got photographic evidence. That short outfit with the snow just looks painful. There's another girl on the list that almost got away with it that still has us cracking up!

## Where's That Girl With The Towel

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779748-1515611478063.jpg) [Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Remember that one girl with the towel wrapped around her waist? Your sis really needs you here! Is she wearing extremely short shorts or is that just her underwear? Wherever she stayed the night before, surely someone could have loaned her some decent pants. Or maybe she had to get out of there so fast that she left her own...

## Business On The Top. Gym In The Middle. Party On The Bottom.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779732.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) You know, if she would've just chosen a different pair of pants for the next morning, she might just look like someone on their way to work. Instead, this is a dead giveaway that she's doing the walk of shame. Somehow, she's _still_ not the last girl on the list who forgot their pants the next morning!

## Almost Got Away With It

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779712.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) If only she had stuffed some flat shoes in her purse, we would have never suspected that this girl had a crazy night and is also probably wearing the sweats of the guy she hooked up with! Hopefully, she's calling a ride so she doesn't have to walk all the way home in those deadly heels. Some of the girls left on the list don't mind the walk home in their stilettos.

## Another Wild Squad Walking Home Together

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779729-1515611890398.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) This shot is the best because you know someone was just looking out their window and saw these three messes walking down the sidewalk. They're another group of ladies that don't care about what they might step on the next day. They're all keeping their heads pretty low, however...

## So Close!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779723-1515611992168.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) This is another girl that almost made it home without anyone seeing her! She's legit shutting the cab door as someone else saps a picture. Other girls might have to do the embarrassing walk, but at least they didn't drive home, right? The look on her face is seriously the best part.

## Just Keep Your Hood Up, You're Almost Home!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779741.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) This looks like a shot taken from a movie. The way her face is hidden, high heels still on, and all three construction workers staring at her, we couldn't think of a better walk of shame! We have to be honest though, while this one is gold, there are still a few pictures left on the list that are somehow better.

## Sis, Go Wash Those Feet!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779736.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) You can tell by how dirty her feet are that she's walked a pretty long way so far. The way her hair is all messed up and she's flipping off the camera seriously make this picture priceless. This girl just wanted a night out but ended up getting totally busted on the way home. Don't worry, we saved the best for last!

## It's 39 Degrees Out In This Picture

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/84779718.jpg) 

[Ebaum's World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/37-party-girls-caught-taking-the-walk-of-shame/84779711/) Some of these pictures look like maybe they were taken at a different time of day and the girls were actually on their way to a party. This one is different. There's no denying that this is definitely a walk of shame! She didn't even bring a coat?!
