Other than being the president, it is indisputable that Donald Trump is entertaining. Most people are divided between hating and loving him; some refer to him as a buffoon. In front of a camera, Trump makes an effort not to show his ego. This has been seen on various occasions from honoring fallen soldiers to his family meetings. The efforts sometimes don't just work! In some instances, he utters disgusting and offensive words against women.

## **1. Lying about contacting fallen soldiers families**

On October 17th, 2017, Trump took the media by surprise explaining how he had reached every family that lost a member in the military. Since then a survey has revealed that more than half of the families were never contacted. Emails also show that the white house officials were trying to cover it up.

Instead of working with McConnel to pass bills after health care has failed, Trump went against him. It could have been the easiest way for him to move tax reforms in the Senate. The fight will probably cost Trump more than he can chew having been friends with McConnel.

## **20.  Not differentiating Presbyterian and Evangelicals**

A story is told of Trump meeting with Presbyterian pastors. In their meeting, he was very proud saying that he did well in the polls thanks to evangelicals. In his mind, he thought Presbyterian and evangelicals are the same. The pastors were quick to correct but were met with the question, "what are you?" He later corrected himself saying that both are Christians.
