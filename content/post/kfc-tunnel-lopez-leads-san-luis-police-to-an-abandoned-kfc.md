Public records reveal that Lopez had bought the former KFC in April, paying some $390,000 in cash for the rundown restaurant.

Once inside, both local and federal authorities were shocked at what they found.

“This was no fried chicken joint any more,” said Williams. “This was the big time.”

Agents chipped away at it’s sides and, as the concrete gave way, the hole became larger and larger.

One person shimmied down into the space and turned on a flashlight, scanning the surroundings.

Hundreds of wooden two-by-four boards lined the walls…
