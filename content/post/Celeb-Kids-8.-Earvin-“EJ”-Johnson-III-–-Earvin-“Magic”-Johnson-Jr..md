“We are talking about people who are not afraid to live their truth,” Earvin said at a Beautycon interview. “That is what beauty is all about, because it’s in the eye of the beholder, honey.”

Despite growing up in Hollywood, the son of “Magic” Johnson lived a relatively quiet life until he was outed by TMZ.

Although he first came out to his family as a teenager, the public wasn’t aware of his sexual orientation until an expose on the gossip show broke the news.
