The eldest of Andy Garcia’s four children, Dominik dreamt of being a dancer when she was a little girl. These days, however, she has been focusing on getting her acting career off the ground.

Dominik most recently appeared in the Simon West-directed 2015 thriller Wild Card. Starring alongside Jason Statham and Michael Angarano, Dominik’s performance was not well received.
