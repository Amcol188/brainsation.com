_Johnson Space Center - NASA_ In case you haven't been paying attention, the flat Earth movement is a serious movement that's gaining momentum -- especially among our younger members of society. Recent polling reveals that 16% of 18-24 year olds are "not sure" that the Earth is a sphere, and 10% of millenials now also have their doubts. It doesn't help that celebrities, like the rapper B.o.B, are also now using their status to push the theory:

Well, recently the flat earthers had a convention and, yes, 200 people actually showed up. The things that they revealed about their beliefs are nothing short of astounding. Here's a sample: Some people believe that the [moon is transparent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S_ckNeGwK8). Others believe that we've never been to space at all, and that the NASA pictures of the Earth from the moon are all fakes. Some even claim to have photographic evidence of [clouds moving behind the sun](https://www.metabunk.org/explained-why-clouds-appear-behind-the-sun-and-moon.t7084/). Oh, and how is the flat Earth held up in space? By pillars, of course:

The whopper of them all belongs to Darren Nesbit for his theory of why we don't fall off of a flat Earth. From [Alphr](http://www.alphr.com/science/1009250/flat-earth-convention-pacman): _His answer is simple: we’re living in a Pac-Man world. Yes, he’s based his hypothesis on a 1980s arcade cabinet. You know how Pac-Man leaves one side of the maze and reappears on the other? You may think this was just a way for game developers to keep things on a single screen, oh no: that’s how we travel from one side of the world to the other, apparently – a theory which seems to raise more questions than it answers._

_SimonOwen.com_ “We know that continuous east-west travel is possible”, Nesbit said. “One logical possibility for those who are truly free thinkers is that space-time wraps around and we get a Pac-Man effect.” Evidence? Nah. In fact, Nesbit’s embrace of pseudoscience seems to be based on two observations: “One is that, go look or stand outside - the world is clearly not moving! I know they fudge a whole load of nonsensical reasons why we don't feel this 1,038 + 67,000 + 500,000 mph motion in different directions but anyone who's ever been in an earthquake knows what it feels like when the Earth really is moving and not perfectly stable.” With him so far? Good, because this free thinker is about to blow your mind. “The other is that no matter where you live on this supposed ball, you seem to live right on top of it. Someone should be living on the side of the ball, with a perfectly vertical landscape, and people should be living underneath it, walking upside down.” Who
