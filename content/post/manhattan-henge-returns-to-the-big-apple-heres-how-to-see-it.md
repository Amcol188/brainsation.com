This time of year marks the return of Manhattanhenge to New York City. It's that magical time of the year when the setting of the sun lines up perfectly with the streets of Manhattan -- most notably 42nd, 34th, and 14th streets.

[EarthSky.org](http://earthsky.org/todays-image/manhattanhenge-may-july-sunset-42nd-34th-14th-sts-nyc) has more on the story: The phenomenon of Manhattanhenge isn’t mysterious, of course. Similar alignments occur around the world, on various dates. Think Stonehenge. The point of sunset along the horizon varies throughout the year. At this time of year – between the March equinox and June solstice – the sunset point is shifting northward each day on the horizon, as seen from around the globe. It’s the northward-shifting path of the sun that gives us summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. The June solstice on June 21 will bring the sun’s northernmost point in our sky – and northernmost sunset – and afterwards the sun’s path in our sky, and the sunset point, will both start shifting southward again.

[Max Pixel](https://www.maxpixel.net/Britain-Stonehenge-Monument-Prehistoric-Salisbury-2326750) As for the sun’s alignment with the city of New York, and the streets of Manhattan Island … well, thank the original planners of this city. Scientific American explained: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/manhattanhenge-what-it-is-and-how-to-see-it/ The phenomenon is based on a design for Manhattan outlined in The Commissioners’ Plan of 1811 for a rectilinear grid, or “gridiron” of straight streets and avenues that intersect one another at right angles. This design runs from north of Houston Street in Lower Manhattan to just south of 155th Street in Upper Manhattan. Most cross streets in between were arranged in a regular right-angled grid that was tilted 29 degrees east of true north to roughly replicate the angle of the island of Manhattan.

Don't worry if you missed the exact date of the effect. You should still be able to get a good viewing for the next day or so, and again in early July.
