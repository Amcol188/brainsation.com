Embarking on a Disney cruise is intended to be a once in a lifetime experience, including character visits and excitement at every turn. Every aspect of the journey—from the food to the entertainment—is magical, but the disappearance of a ship's employee in 2011 brought the joyful voyage to a sudden halt. The tragic disappearance of employee Rebecca Coriam on the cruise ship the _Wonder_ in 2011 is still unexplained to this day, but there have been a couple of encouraging new breaks in the case that took our breath away. Read on to find out more!

[Greeningz](http://www.greeningz.com/interesting/new-evidence-missing-disney-crew-member/) As the Wonder left the port, Coriam left her mother one final message on Facebook. She claimed she would call her mother the following day, but when that call never came it raised a few red flags.

## Her Parents Began To Panic

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_worried-1499612266560.jpg)

## Law Enforcement And The Coast Guard Were Notified

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_cat-1499613318041.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) The captain of the ship then notified the U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Police Force of Coriam's sudden disappearance, and Bahamian Police Force began an investigation of the _Wonder_ and the surrounding water.

## An Investigation Was Put Into Motion

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_front-1499613498223.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) The Bahamian police searched the ship and the water for this missing woman, but all searches came up short. The following slide reveals that the investigation may not have been as detailed as law enforcement described.

## No Passengers Were Interviewed About The Incident

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_interview-1499613692818.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) Coriam's parents learned that only a couple of crew members were questioned and none of the passengers were even made aware of any investigation. Even so, the Bahamian police came to a conclusion.

## No Foul Play Was Reported By Bahamian Police

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_foulplay-1499614037850.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) The local police force determined that no foul play had occurred in connection with the disappearance of 24-year-old Coriam, but the Bahamian police did have an idea of what happened to the young woman on that fateful morning.

## Police Had Multiple Theories Regarding Her Sudden Disappearance

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_deck5-1499614189617.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) “We were given cakes and then taken to the captain who sat us down and told us it was his belief our daughter had gone out to Deck Five and a wave had hit the ship and taken her over," Coriam's parents stated. One of the woman's close friends didn't totally buy this theory.

## Her Close Friend Melissa Had Other Ideas

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_friend-1499614474633.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgc1dqhCsQ) Coriam's friend Melissa believes that is it possible that she accidentally fell into the water on Deck 5, but she also points that the company is hiding something and covering up details of the disappearance to "protect the brand." Coriam's parents are also not convinced they are getting the whole story.

## Her Parents Felt That They Were Being Lied To

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_statement-1499614823150.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9wi1WH0P3I) Disney provided Coriam's parents with their daughter's belongings found on Deck 5, but something was off. A pair of flip flops they gave to the family was not even Coriam's, as they had a different crew member's name and cabin number written on the side.

## The Coriams Decided To Pursue Legal Action

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_sue-1499615120237.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9wi1WH0P3I) Mike and Ann Coriam decided to sue the Disney company, as they believe they did not handle the case in a timely manner. The company took an entire seven hours to notify the Bahamian police of the incident, but the company stood by their decisions on the matter. The two parties settled outside of court in 2015, but more recent findings in the case of Coriam's disappearance have emerged!

## Rebecca's Bank Account Has Since Been In Use

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_bank-1499616046466.jpg) 

[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/atm-withdraw-cash-map-ec-card-1524870/) Only a few weeks after their daughter's disappearance, the Coriams received an email stating that there had been recent activity on their daughter's bank account. _“_This could be a very significant development. The fact that her credit card’s been used could only mean someone has stolen it or she’s still alive," Coriam's father Mike stated.

## Her Facebook Password Was Changed Unexpectedly

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_typing-1499615897471.jpg) 

[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/laptop-human-hands-keyboard-typing-820274/) Another development in this story leaves many to believe Rebecca Coriam is still alive. During September of 2011, her Facebook password was mysteriously changed, and no one could pinpoint who was the culprit.

## She Was Supposedly Spotted A Year Later

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_spotted-1499615793709.jpg) 

[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/alley-girl-walking-shadow-young-2344397/) Only a year after her disappearance, someone claimed to have seen Rebecca Coriam with a dark-haired male in Venice, Italy. Although she was not found despite this sighting, the family still hold hope that she is out there, somewhere.

## The Search Is Still On For Rebecca Coriam

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/disney_final-1499615651986.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5j74JJzaFE) The young woman is still missing at sea. The Coriam family has not stopped searching, and they have even set up a website to help keep the public involved in the search for their daughter. Over 160 people have gone missing while on cruises since 1995, and the Coriam case is just another one that has yet to be solved!
