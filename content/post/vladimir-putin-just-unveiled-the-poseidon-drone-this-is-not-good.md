If Vladimir Putin's plans come to fruition, the Russians will soon have an underwater drone capable of wreaking disastrous havoc. TASS is reporting that Russia is working on a nuclear powered underwater drone capable of carrying a two megatonne nuclear warhead.

[Kremlin.ru](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57018) From the [Daily Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-unveils-underwater-poseidon-12554382): _"It will be possible to mount various nuclear charges on the ‘torpedo’ of the Poseidon multipurpose seaborne system, with the thermonuclear single warhead... to have the maximum capacity of up to 2 megatonnes in TNT equivalent." With its nuclear munition, the underwater drone "is primarily designed to destroy reinforced naval bases of a potential enemy," the source said._

 [_Daily Mirror_](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-unveils-underwater-poseidon-12554382) _The drone will have a speed of 60-70 knots and will be operational at a depth of more than 1km._ The Russians certainly have high hopes for their new weapon of mass destruction. Putin boasted that the Poseidon will have "will have 'hardly any vulnerabilities' and said it would carry a 'massive nuclear ordinance'. He added: 'There is simply nothing in the world capable of withstanding them.'"

[Daily Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-unveils-underwater-poseidon-12554382) Certainly, Putin likes to talk big, but would a weapon like this really be capable of massive destruction? Rex Richardson, a physicist, addressed that issue in an interview with Business Insider, and his answer was quite chilling: _"A well-placed nuclear weapon of yield in the range 20 MT to 50 MT near a sea coast could certainly couple enough energy to equal the 2011 tsunami, and perhaps much more. "Taking advantage of the rising-sea-floor amplification effect, tsunami waves reaching 100 meters \[330 feet\] in height are possible.”_ For our sake and the safety of the whole world, let's hope this thing sinks like a rock.
