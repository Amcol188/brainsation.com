The story of David and Goliath is one of the most widely known stories in the world. It's hard to read about one sports team upsetting another without hearing it used as a parable. It even shows up in the Koran. Yet, historians have yet to agree on whether or not David was a real person.

From the [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/699592/bible-historical-evidence-israel-king-david-jesus-christ-city-found-eglon-avraham-faust): _Archaeologists are divided over whether or not Biblical figures such as King David and King Solomon ever existed._

_Avraham Faust - Daily Star_ Professor Avraham Faust, co-head of the archaeological dig, said he believes this latest discovery further supports the case for the historical accuracy of the Bible. He claims the latest discovery is clear to have been “part of the events in the Bible ascribed to the Kingdom of David”. Archaeologists were aided by burrowing mole rats, who bring earth to the surface which gives them a clue as to what is hiding below. Professor Faust and Yair Sapir, of Bar-Ilan University, believe the building could be part of the city of Eglon.

_City of Eglon - Creative Commons_ The city is mentioned in the Bible as one of the five who fought against the Israelites before being conquered. Historians question the use of the Bible as a historical reference as most events mentioned in the text lack historical evidence. Dr Faust told Breaking Israel News: "We, of course, did not find any artifacts that said ‘King David’ or King Solomon’ but we discovered site signs of a social transformation in the region which are consistent with a change from Canaanite culture to a Judean culture.

“Since it took place at a time we believed the Kingdom of David began to spread into this region, it is clear this building was part of the events in the Bible ascribed to the Kingdom of David.” He added: "The structure was excavated, almost in its entirety, and was composed of a large courtyard with rooms on three side. "Hundreds of artefacts were unearthed within the debris, including a wide range of pottery vessels, loom weights, many metal objects, botanical remains, as well as many arrowheads, evidence of the battle which accompanied the conquest of the site by the Assyrians.” What do you think? Was David a real king of Israel? Does this new discovery sway your mind one way or the other?
