[pinkfinishpicture](http://pinkfinishpicture.com/blog-entry-16654.html) You might think that sports are all about good timing in the first place, and that's certainly true. You need that perfect opportunity to set up a field goal or find space to drop the ball in the basket. But that's a different kind of timing than _comedic_ timing, and we want to laugh today. These fantastic photos are moments that won't ever happen again. They required a lucky photographer to be in the right place at the right time. Many of them convey the athletic determination of the sports star while still providing you with a wonderful laugh. Enjoy them.

## What Smells So Bad?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/images-revc.jpg)

[tweetcs](https://tweetcs.com/index.php) This is extremely unfortunate for the guy in blue.  It looks his head has slipped into the stinky place where the sun don't shine.  But, as bad as it may be for guy in blue, you gotta imagine it's not all too comfortable for Red either!

## Should've Kept Your Mask On

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/Perfectly-Timed-Sports-Pics-11-519x410.jpg)

[pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/494833077785587662/?autologin=true) This is just painful and embarrasing.  Taking a baseball to the face, thrown from a Major Leaguer, has got to be one of the more painful things in life.  Add to the fact the guy scored easily, and this catcher is not having his best day.

## The Crowd Couldn't Believe What Began To Happen!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Perfectly-timed-pictures-WWE.jpg)

[stillrealtous](http://stillrealtous.com/13-awesome-awful-photos/) Looks like Hulk Hogan is getting a little 'happy ending' to this wrestling match.  The added expression on Hollywood Hulk's face combined with the way they are holding hands, really put this picture over the top.

## Let's See What You've Been Eating...

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/images-1.jpg)

[imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/EpXZH) These two soccer players may be on opposing teams, but it looks like they are getting to know each other very, very well right here.  I can't tell if that is a look of enjoyment or pain on the bottom guys face?

## There's No Kissing In Hockey

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/Perfectly-Timed-Sports-Pics-5-410x410.jpg)

[twitter](https://twitter.com/nkhlh) Hockey is traditionally known for fighting.  It is the ultimate tough guy sport.  'Hockey Tough' is a saying for a reason.  They two players, however, and trying to break the mold.  They are lovers, not fighters!

## Servin' Em Up

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pnGL3P6ULp17cowqyKDhFaUoo1_500.jpg)

[rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/board_message?message_id=2081477) This tennis crowd is definitely getting more than they paid for.  Those babies cannot be contained.  It can't be easy playing tennis like that.

## When The Ball Bounces Back

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-1515625427722.jpg) 

[Baku](http://az.baku.ws/lifestyle/12379-bu-killr-diqqtl-baxn-foto.html) This pitcher appears to have uncovered a whole new way to throw. It may mean that future generations of pitchers need to be double-jointed for it to catch on. This had to have hurt, but we can't find any reports that he was injured during the game. It's a home run for him.

## When You Have Complete Ball Control

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-1515625533435.jpg) 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/bf8bD) Last time we looked at the rules of soccer, we're pretty sure they said that they require you to play the game with your feet. Having said that, we'd be amenable to a change in those rules if it resulted in acrobatics like this. This girl's hand control of the ball is absolutely incredible.

## The Penalty At The Penalty

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3-1515625639789.jpg) 

[SETI](http://www.seti.ee/modules/news/article.php?storyid=27607) In soccer, the spot kick is a big deal, and it's a huge opportunity to score a goal. The normal response is to line up in front of the person taking the shot and block the ball from going into the net. What's not so normal is the guy next to you grabbing your shorts as you start to jump in the air. That could be embarrassing.

## The Hockey Player Who Went MIA

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5260488-1515627017244.jpg) 

[Yaplakal](https://www.yaplakal.com/forum2/topic1089488.html) Ice hockey is all about wild and violent clashes between players. Without that, it would be boring. Yet, most of the time when two players fly into each other, they keep their heads. This is one instance where that rule hasn't held up, as the one player's head has cartoonishly disappeared into his jersey.

## Pucking Hell

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/perfectly-timed-sport-moments-8-e1482927384104.jpg)

[Sportingz](http://www.sportingz.com/sports/las-esposas-de-los-famosos-antes-y-ahora/18/)

That moment when the puck rises from the ice and starts bearing down on your face is never a good one. When somebody catches it on camera, you can imagine why. Ice hockey is a tough game at the best of times, but for this player, it's about to become tougher.

## It's Snot An Excuse

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4d0b331ee6ae9-1515625871477.png) 

[Joins](http://blog.joins.com/media/folderlistslide.asp?uid=ohpax&folder=66&list_id=11967080) We have a lot of sympathy for this young lady. Ice skating rinks are kept cold, obviously, and it's fair to say that most of us find that cold air makes our nose run. Yet, when you're a professional figure skater in the middle of a routine, you can't wipe your nose, so... you do this instead. Gross but necessary.

## The Rodman Is The Man

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/003630jre1zc11xyviyrbi-1515625953927.jpg) 

[Science Net](http://blog.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=215459&do=blog&id=740186) Say what you like about Dennis Rodman's bizarre friendship with genocidal dictators, he was THE MAN on a basketball court. Here you see that all the effort he put into practice paid off. He learned to fly like superman just for his sport. Nobody can beat that for effort.

## Yawn!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/14-4.jpg)

[Buzzaloud](https://www.buzzaloud.com/top-30-perfectly-timed-female-sports-photos/3/) We can think of plenty of boring sports. Darts and dominoes spring to mind as easy examples. But one sport that we'd never have thought would get boring for participants is the pole vault. This Olympic pole vaulter, however, went out of her way to prove us wrong. She's falling asleep even as she falls...

## The Photobomb To End All Photobombs

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/a64127263a9c1154a413d3ba5bcb487c_original.jpg)

[Funny Or Die](http://www.funnyordie.com/slideshows/a03a6371d8/olympians-making-derp-faces) There's only one sport in which bombing is an accepted technique and that's diving. If you've got to get into the water, sometimes you've got to do it quickly, and a good old-fashioned cannonball is the fastest way to go. We're not sure why she felt the need to pull this face at the same time, but we are glad that she did.

## Give Me My Shoe Back!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/69f10ad936165d7e30203d9a10e9bd9c-1515626259921.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/265571709256519488/?lp=true) We've all had one of those awkward moments when a shoe got stuck in something and fell off. Most of us, however, haven't had one of those moments during an Olympic Hurdling session. That's what happened to this poor Ethiopian lady as she flew over the hurdle, but she still finished the race!

## Long Jump Ninja!

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/Timed18-780x520-768x512.jpg)

[Worldation](http://www.worldation.com/opinions/69-perfectly-timed-photos-sports/) We are absolutely positive that doing a long jump is hard work and that it takes a lot out of you. Yet, we remain unconvinced that it helps to make a face like the Incredible Hulk and to punch the air while you jump. But what would we know? He's the Olympian, not us.

## The Creature From The Olympic Swimming Pool

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ewuz1m5-1515626419019.jpg) 

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ewUz1M5) This photo is absolutely amazing. It's the exact moment as the swimmer emerges from the water. And it's the water's unusual light refracting properties that turn him from a man into a monster. We don't know if he won his race, but he sure won the best-presented swimmer that year.

## Flying Through The Air Has Never Been So Easy

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2.jpg)

[Anepedia](https://www.anepedia.org/%D0%A4%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8B/?page=79)

This bull rider would have known that his ride wasn't exactly risk-free, but this is still quite a sight. Here, you have him in the moment after he's been thrown from the bull and is pulling an aerial handstand to relieve his fall. Unfortunately, the bull is still right behind him...

## The Strangest Bench In The World

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4caaee56cd8e4-1515626558945.png) 

[Joins](http://blog.joins.com/media/folderlistslide.asp?uid=ohpax&folder=66&list_id=11851418) Sometimes, you see a photograph that is so strange that you are afraid to learn the story behind it. This is one of those photos. Yes, it's an old man sitting on a young girl, and if this wasn't the Olympics, he'd probably have been arrested. Apparently, this is what gymnastics training looks like.

## That Magnificent Two-Wheeled Flying Machine

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/daily_picdump_weekend_640_69.jpg)

[Blogspot](http://crazylazysilly.blogspot.com/2011/04/moto-bikin.html)

We've seen some dangerous moments on this list, but this one can't be topped. It's a BMX biker performing stunts, one of which involves balancing upside down on his bike while holding a cable in mid-air. It's both funny and terrifying in the same instant.

## On The Wet Head, Son

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/original-1515626750899.jpg) 

[Mirtesen](http://s30045428884.mirtesen.ru/blog/43706547667/Futbol-i-bolelschiki) Soccer fans will know that occasionally players headbutt the ball and cries of "on my head, son" will be heard just before it. What most fans don't know is that the ball is heavier when it rains. This wonderful moment of a wet head contacting a wet ball comes at the price of a few brain cells.

## The Four-Armed Footballer

![](http://fb.americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/00011af0_big.jpeg)

[Fishki](https://fishki.net/photo/1232464-fotopodborka-za-12122013.html) This is a funny photo which shows a four-armed footballer playing for two sides at once. The next time that someone tells you "genetic engineering is perfectly safe," show them this photo. Then tell them to be afraid, very afraid. Having said that, we actually don't understand why he's not playing in goal.

## The Contrast Of Two Worlds Colliding

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/eef8a78492866dbed4e61657fc035284-1515626945253.jpg) 

[Stylist](https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/burkini-ban-nice-france-muslim-islam-bikini-swimming-feminism-sexism/120534) On the left, we have your traditional women's volleyball team. Young, tanned and barely wearing a stitch of clothing. On the right, we have a lady from Egpyt's volleyball team. Egypt is an Islamic country and that means women are encouraged to cover themselves up. So, she did.

## Where Did He Go?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/headlessfootball-1515625683728.jpg) 

[DAOT](http://daot.tk/funny-football-mishaps/) This scene from an NFL game makes us think of the Queen of Hearts. Off with his head! Guys get hit all the time in a physical game, but most of them don't lose their heads over it. We have no idea how hard this guys was hit, but it was enough to knock his helmet off and lift his shoulder pads and jersey over his head for this great photo.

## Reflecting On Your Sport

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/998849_553917304669724_6342091_n-1515627102502.jpg) 

[Ballinonabudget](http://www.ballinonabudget.tv/entertainment/image-intoxication-120/) If you can't afford a mirror at home, we have a special tip for you to be able to see your own reflection perfectly. Tie your feet to a wooden board. Tie the wooden board to a boat. Lean sideways and stare directly down at the water. Now comb your hair. On second thought, don't do that last thing. It might be fatal.
