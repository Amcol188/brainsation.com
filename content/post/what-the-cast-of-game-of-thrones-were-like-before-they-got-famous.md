_Game of Thrones_ is undoubtedly one of the most popular shows to have ever graced the small screen. With its vast world and intriguing characters, this monster HBO original from writer George R.R. Martin premiered to great acclaim and a healthy fan craze. Part of the success is the cast, who are made up of some well-known names and newcomers alike.

Here is a look at what some of the brilliant cast was up to before they entered the world of Westeros.

## From Supporting Roles... (Peter Dinklage)

It's no secret that Peter Dinklage has become the top dog since _GOT_'s first season. But before that, Dinklage was making a name for himself as a strong supporting player in movies such as _Death at a Funeral_, _Elf_, _The Chronicles of Narnia_ and _Find Me Guilty_.

## To The Spotlight - (Tyrion Lannister)

But thanks to his role as Tyrion Lannister, Dinklage has finally found the recognition he has so richly deserved (and some nice awards for his shelf too).

## From Early Accolades.... (Maisie Williams)

[Time](http://time.com/3951804/game-of-thrones-maisie-williams-comic-con/)

Right from the start, Maisie Williams has achieved critical success, having won the London Film Critics Circle Award for her feature film debut _The Falling_.

## To Even More Awards - (Arya Stark)

But now thanks to her turn as Arya Stark of Winterfell, Williams has chalked up an Emmy nomination and international fame. Not bad for someone her age.

## Roots In Sci-FI And Fantasy.... (Lena Heady)

[TV Guide](http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/terminator-sarah-connor-chronicles/photos/288110/11100/)

Lena Headey is no stranger to sci-fi and fantasy, having had some of her biggest roles in projects such as _The Sarah Conner Chronicles_ and the _300_ film series.

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister)

But thanks to her work as Cersei Lannister, Headey has moved on from cult hits to full-on fantasy/sci-fi queen, earning both fame and critical acclaim for her work.

## From Pretty Face.... (Kit Harington)

[Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/02/kit-harington-pompeii-workout)

Before _GOT_, Kit Harington was one of those actors in movies such as _Pompeii_ and _Silent Hill: Revelation_ that you probably remember by looking at him, but not by his name.

## To Ultimate Fan Favorite - (Jon Snow)

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow)

However, after landing the plum role of Jon Snow, Harington's name is now plastered on the lips of every _GOT_ fan, and even a few people that don't even watch the show.

## From One Fantasy Franchise... (Sean Bean)

Actor Sean Bean has been a respected name in film for a long time and has even appeared in legendary franchises such as _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy.  Giving him one of the all-time great meme photos.

Natalie Dormer has quite a resume, with roles that vary from the likes of _Captain America: The First Avenger_ to playing Anne Boleyn on _The Tudors_.

_Game of Thrones_ was Sophie Turner's big time debut, and it allowed her to wet her feet in a few small indie movies such as _Barely Lethal_ and _Another Me_, usually in supporting roles.

## To The Big Time - (Sansa Stark)

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen)

_Game of Thrones_ has put her on the path to even greener pastures with roles in films such as _Me Before You_, _Terminator: Genisys_, and the upcoming _Han Solo_ film. Not bad at all.

## Definitely Memorable... (Jason Mamoa)

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ygritte)

Rose Leslie played Ygritte, Jon Snow's former lover who met an untimely death in Season 4. But just because her time was cut short doesn't mean Rose Leslie fell into the background.

[PinThisStar](http://pinthisstar.com/charles-dance.html)

It should come as no surprise that Charles Dance, the man who plays Tywin Lannister, has a history of playing the domineering, ruthless bad guy.

## Out Of Being A Villain - (Tywin Lannister)

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tywin-lannister-1501541625976-1.jpg) 

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister)

With roles in _Underworld: Blood Wars _and _Dracula Untold_ under his belt, he has made a brand of being the big bad, and will probably do so in any future project.

[IMGFlash](http://www.imgflash.org/jack-gleeson-batman.html)

It takes a lot to leap from small parts such as "Little Boy" in _Batman Begins_ and "Kid" in _Reign of Fire_, but that is exactly what Jack Gleeson did.

## To The Most Hated Person On TV - (Joffrey Baratheon)

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/joffrey-2-1501543281766-1.jpg)

[Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Gleeson)

Plus he made a splash as Joffrey Baratheon, the spoiled (to say the least) child who eventually would become one of the most hated characters in all of TV.
