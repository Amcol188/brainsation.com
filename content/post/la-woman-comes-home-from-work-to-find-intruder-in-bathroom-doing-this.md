Picture this scenario: You had a long day at work and cannot wait to get home, change into something more comfortable, put your feet up and finally relax. For one Monroe, Louisiana resident such a wish did not end as expected.

In the late afternoon of April 17, an unidentified woman entered her home, weary from hours at her job, to find someone had already gone into her house and was still there. **Multitasking** [The Smoking Gun](http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/cheetos-bathtub-burglar-839051) reports that the homeowner came across naked 29-year-old Evelyn Washington, also a resident of Monroe, lying in her bathtub eating Cheetos from a plate atop the toilet.

An officer who later arrived on the scene told a local newspaper that the tub was “full of water and a plate of food along with half-eaten Cheetos belonging to the victim on the toilet next to the tub.” Move over ‘smash and grab’ because here comes ‘tub and grub’.

**Bizarre Motive** After finding Washington tubbing and grubbing, the homeowner demanded to know what she was doing and why she was in the house. Washington replied that a man she did not know told her to break into the home. Police say that Washington did just that, breaking a window to enter the home. Why she decided to take a bath and pop Cheetos into her mouth is unknown at this time.

The Smoking Gun writes, “Seen in the above mug shot, Washington was arrested for burglary and criminal damage to property. She is locked up in lieu of $8000 bond at the Ouachita Correctional Center.” **High Crime**

According to [CityData.com](http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Monroe-Louisiana.html), Monroe (with a population of around 48,000) experienced just shy of 2100 burglaries in 2016, 3400 thefts, 250 robberies and 22 murders.
