When a Kathy Bero of Delafield, Wisconsin was diagnosed with cancer, doctors set her prognosis for survival at 21 months. The then 41 year old mother of two tried surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, all to no avail, and her condition was getting progressively worse.

[Kathy Bero Website](https://www.kathymydlachbero.com/) She was soon diagnosed with another tumor in her head and neck and the medication was taking a devastating toll on her body. Here's more on her story from [Hawaii News Now](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38301478/woman-battles-cancer-with-diet-harvard-researchers-to-study-her-approach): "My kidneys were failing; my liver was failing," Bero said. "My lungs were damaged. My heart was damaged. I told my oncologist that I'm done with that protocol because one way or another, I'm going to die. And I don't want to go that way." It was then she decided to go off chemotherapy and use a strategy suggested by a friend. "My friend kept saying you have to learn about anti-angiogenic foods," Bero said.

Examples include organic vegetables such as purple potatoes, carrots and leeks. "Leeks are at the top of the cancer-fighting list," Bero said. Also on her list: berries, walnuts, green tea and herbs, especially garlic. "When a recipe calls for two cloves, I’m probably going to put in six because garlic is a really strong cancer fighter," Bero said. Bero said her diet - combined with a type of alternative medicine called Reiki, along with meditation and visualization - worked. "My doctors just kept saying, 'Huh. That is interesting,'" she said.

Now, 12 years later, Bero is 54 years old, cancer free, and is now working as a cancer coach, teaching others the remedy that saved her life. Best of all, researchers at Harvard have taken notice and have started researching her methods. Bero said Harvard researchers will study people who've had exceptional outcomes. "They're looking at our genetics and the genetics of the tumor," Bero said. "What the outliers did; their attitude, environment, faith, social support. What they're trying to do is create a database of all these different things and look for the commonalities between these people." The lead Harvard researcher, Dr. Isaac Kohane, said that because these outcomes are so rare, this particular study will take some time to complete.
