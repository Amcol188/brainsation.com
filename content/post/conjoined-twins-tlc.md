Abby and Brittany have control of one arm and one leg each. They've had to overcome significant challenges in order to walk, swim, and even brush their hair.

The girls first drew the attention of mainstream media in 1996 when they appeared on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_. After that appearance, they lived a quiet life with their family in Minnesota. They kept out of the spotlight, busying themselves with friends, their hobbies, and schoolwork.

That's when everything began to change for the girls...

\### When the Hensel twins turned 16, they agreed to appear in a documentary for TLC. The broadcaster eventually gave them their own show, called _Abby and Brittany_, which premiered on Aug. 28, 2012.

The series followed them on many of their milestones. For example, on their 16th birthday, Abigail and Brittany passed their driving test with a mind-boggling feat of teamwork.

"Yeah, learning to drive was crazy. Abby gets road rage," said Brittany, laughing at her sister.

"That's not true," Abby retorted.

Their mother, Patty, conceded that driving could have been a problem for the girls.

“I don’t know what would happen if they got pulled over for speeding," she said. "Would they each get a ticket or just Abby because it’s her foot on the accelerator?”

That's a fair question!

Although the twins have been able to surmount so many challenges in their young lives, nothing had prepared them for what came next...
