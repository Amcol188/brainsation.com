[C|Net](https://www.cnet.com/news/donald-trump-itchy-twitter-thumbs-politics-election-russia/) It's no secret that in order to be elected president, you have to have some unique qualities. Sometimes it's bravery. Sometimes it's charm. Many would argue that sometimes, it's just the ability to attract a wealthy and generous donor base. No matter what the specific appeal may be, it is true that no average person can coast to the Oval Office without having to work for it. When it comes to running the most powerful nation in the world, the standards are high and the stakes are higher. Read on to learn which presidents truly had the brains for the job.

## George W. Bush - 124

Many were (and still are) skeptical about the mental power of President George W. Bush throughout his two-term tenure, with his famous tendency to mix up his vocabulary only fueling the debate. His IQ of 124 is in the average college graduate range. Whether that meets presidential standards is for Americans to decide.

## Andrew Jackson - 125

After initially gaining fame as a brutal war general, Jackson went on to sign the controversial Indian Removal Act, an event which is now largely regarded as a tragedy.

## Gerald Ford - 127

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford) It's no secret that America loves its sports, so why not have a president who represents that passion? With an IQ of 127, Gerald Ford may not have been the most academic president, but his solid grades combined with his high-level athletic career provided essential leadership skills just the same.

## Herbert Hoover - 130

[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/19749454734) One of the more low-key former presidents, Herbert Hoover's beginnings were just as humble as his legacy. With a slightly-above-average IQ of 130, Hoover worked his way up from his small Iowa hometown to eventually become accepted into Stanford University, though he barely managed to pass the test.

## Ronald Reagan - 130

[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/carolinapixel/4313696073) Universally charming as he may have been, Ronald Reagan was not always the most intellectual leader with an IQ of just 130. One could argue that this occasionally sprung up in his political practices (looking at you, trickle-down economics), but his earnest devotion to reinvigorating American politics never faltered.

## George H.W. Bush - 130

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush) As the oldest living former president and the patriarch of the Bush dynasty, George H.W. Bush also boasts the highest IQ (130) of any of his political family members. His intelligence was evident long before his presidency, as he served in the Navy and even graduated from Yale University.

## Richard Nixon - 131

[Good Free Photos](https://www.goodfreephotos.com/people/richard-nixon-photo.jpg.php) Though far from the most personable (or even just the most ethical) leader, former president Richard Nixon was a relatively sharp cookie as evidenced by his IQ of 131. He earned his bachelor's degree from Whittier in 1934 before going on to graduate from Duke University three years later.

## Dwight D. Eisenhower - 132

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) Long before being inaugurated as the 34th president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower had a list of accomplishments fit for the history books. With an IQ of 132 and the bravery to match, Eisenhower was a five-star general who went on to fiercely advocate in support of the Civil Rights movement.

## George Washington - 133

[George Washington](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/George_Washington) Due to his family's circumstances, George Washington had little access to schooling or even simply educational literature growing up. He did, however, have an IQ of 133, which very likely could have contributed to the world-changing leadership abilities he would later demonstrate as a revolutionary general and founding father.

## Franklin D. Roosevelt - 140

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt) Throughout his presidency and even long after his death, Franklin D. Roosevelt was regarded as an intellectual powerhouse. His IQ, scoring at nearly 140, reflects his ingenious foresight and strategic awareness. These qualities are what carried him through a year 12-year-long presidency wrought with world wars and economic turmoil.

## Lyndon B. Johnson - 140

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/800px-lyndon_b-1515641550739.jpg) 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson) A Texas democrat with uniquely diverse government experience, Lyndon B. Johnson was no stranger to change when he was suddenly sworn in as president following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy, ultimately going on to win re-election. Perhaps it was his unusually high IQ (140) that helped him adapt.

## Abraham Lincoln - 140

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln) Famously born in a log cabin on a modest Indiana farm, Abraham Lincoln was not given much access to education growing up. With an IQ of 140, his brain power made up for his lack of academic experience. He went on to secure patents, win elections, and even engineer the end of the Civil War.

## Barack Obama - 145

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) In 2008, Barack Obama became the first African-American president of the United States, a feat that requires serious dedication -- and some serious brain power. Prior to his political career, Obama studied constitutional law at Harvard, where he graduated in the top 15% of his class. His IQ is a staggering 145.

## Theodore Roosevelt - 149

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) Today, pop culture knows Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt for his legendary sense of adventure, but the politician, explorer, soldier, and naturalist also had quite an intellectual side as well. Before he served as president, Roosevelt graduated from Harvard and went on to study law at Columbia. His IQ? A whopping 149.

## Jimmy Carter - 153

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter) Born on a successful peanut farm in Georgia, Jimmy Carter's IQ of 153 took him far past his rural roots. Not only is he known for serving as the 39th president of the United States; he also won a Nobel Prize in 2002 for his devotion to advancing international human rights.

## John F. Kennedy - 158

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jfk-at-100-ap-6007150193.jpg) 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy) A lot has been said about the revolutionary John F. Kennedy, who was taken from the world long before his time. To many, the progressive Harvard graduate-turned-president was a symbol of hope in a turbulent period of American history. Also an accomplished World War II Navy man, he boasted an IQ of 158.

## Bill Clinton - 158

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/800px-bill_clinton_visit_to_los_alamos-1515642077424.jpg) 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton) There are very few humans on earth that have publicly demonstrated such a wildly varying sense of judgment as former President Bill Clinton. With a law degree from Yale and a slew of sex scandals plaguing his personal history, the book-smart Rhodes scholar still maintains an IQ of 158.

## Thomas Jefferson - 160

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/800px-thomas_jefferson_by_matthew_harris_jouett-1515642160524.jpg) 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) To many, the name Thomas Jefferson is synonymousÂ with genius. Though he was our nation's third president, this founding father's legacy extends far beyond his time in the White House. It's no wonder that the tax-smashing author behind the Declaration of Independence had an IQ of nearly 160.

## John Quincy Adams - 168

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/john_q-1515642240231.jpg) 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams) Legendary for being philosophically centuries ahead of his time, it's no surprise that John Quincy Adams had epic diplomacy skills; he got it from his dad, founding father and second President John Adams. With an IQ of 168, the famed Amistad negotiator must have inherited his brains as well.

## Donald Trump - 120

It's no secret that Donald Trump's style is not exactly traditional. His candid Twitter rants and scattered speeches often leave audiences questioning his intelligence and even mental stability. Though he has never released his official school transcripts, experts have estimated that the former reality star's IQ is likely around 120, historically on the low end of the presidential range.
