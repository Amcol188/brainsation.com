[Netflix](http://people.com/crime/sister-cathy-cesnik-murder-mystery-netflix-show/) Some cases become so mystifying that they become lost in the shuffle. Others tend to be dusted off with even a morsel of new evidence presented. The case you're about to read about became so bizarre that it's the subject of a new documentary. The subject of this case had big dreams as a high schooler...

## The Brightest In The Room

[Netflix](http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/797744/the-keepers-netflix-release-date-trailer-sister-cathy-cesnik) Aside from being valedictorian, Cesnik spent time focusing on other aspects of school life. She was also the president of the student council and the May Queen. With all that knowledge, her next step wasn't surprising...

## Building The Future

While it stayed in the crime lab, the cops concluded that Cesnik took a walk in the woods nearby. They searched the region and found nothing. Almost two months later, a shocking discovery was made...

## A Tragic Finding

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/149941499597-1499416389775.jpg) 

[Netflix](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Netflix-Keepers-True-Story-43453106) On January 3, 1970, two hunters found Cesnik's body underneath some snow in Lansdowne. Since the distance from the town to her apartment was long, police assumed she was forced to walk there by someone.

## A Violent End

[The Baltimore Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swx3xcYjXSc) During the autopsy, it was discovered that she had suffered a skull fracture. Doctors stated that it was from a strike to the head with an object. Seven years later, the case was forgotten about. Until police found some new clues to help solve the mystery...

## Allegations In The Air

[Netflix](https://mic.com/articles/178504/the-keepers-update-the-latest-on-sister-cathy-cesniks-case#.NIfZC5ZsE) In 1992, Reverend A. Joseph Maskell was accused of sexually abusing former students from Archbishop Keough High School. He was removed from his position from Holy Cross Church after these allegations came to light.

## A Second Chance

[Netflix](http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/priest-who-came-to-ireland-in-1990s-linked-to-nuns-murder-in-new-netflix-documentary-the-keepers-35715533.html) The student explained that Cesnik was murdered by Maskell. The reasoning behind it was Maskell trying to hide molestation allegations against him. Since Cesnik knew about it, he chose to end her life. What the police did next was truly baffling...

## Not Buying It

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/60e7c9d52a3e903172a23a6c9bcdf25d-1499414384932.jpg) 

[Archdiocese of Baltimore](http://people.com/crime/sister-cathy-cesnik-murder-mystery-netflix-show/) The police didn't believe one word from the student. While she gave detailed information on Cesnik's body, they felt her story was inconsistent.

[The Baltimore Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swx3xcYjXSc) The police didn't consider Maskell a major suspect in Cesnik's death. They did interview him several times, though. A $6,000 reward was also set for those with crucial information leading to the killer.
