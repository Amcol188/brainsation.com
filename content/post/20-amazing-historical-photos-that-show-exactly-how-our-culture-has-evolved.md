They say that the past can teach us many lessons, but the truth is that many of us never paid that much attention in history classes at school. That's because history in school is always so boring. Who wants to be bored all the time? Not us. So, we don't remember much from back then. That's why we've delved into the archives to bring you 20 images from the past with real stories to tell. You're going to love learning about these moments because they're not boring. We promise that you'll remember them much better than anything you learned at school.

She also appeared in _Star Trek_ as a slave girl in the controversial episode "Whom Gods Destroy." She continued to act for many more years and last worked in 2011 as the voice over of "Grandma" on the TV show _Olivia_.

Brigitte Bardot was once every young man's dream and, along with Marilyn Monroe, she shaped the concept of the "blonde bombshell" as a sex symbol in popular culture. Her pose in photographs is so compelling that women in modeling work very hard to emulate her even today. She retired as a model at the age of 39 in 1973.

## The Real Rock And Roll Lifestyle With Joan Jett

[Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/14/brad_elterman_cool_photographs_of_celebrities_from_the_1960s_70s_and_80s.html) Yes, this is Joan Jett of "I Love Rock n' Roll" fame, and this is her chilling out on tour. You will note the absence of drugs and booze and instead, despite the hard rocking demeanor, she's watching TV to relax, just like normal folks with office jobs do.

## The Day That Discrimination Died

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5a-1518013754856-1.jpg) 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/thevikaskhanna/status/897709859449294848) As he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, President Lyndon Johnson told onlookers, "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long." It was the beginning of equality for all Americans.

## Before The Washington Monument Was Finished

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7a-1518013887440-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/640426009480899118/) Today, it's a national icon, but back when it was first being built, it was stuck for a long time in this unfinished state because there were no public funds to complete the job. Yes, this is the Washington Monument under construction. It began in 1848 but wasn't finished until 1888!

## The Special Relationship

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8a-1518013952117-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/387802217906538080/) British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former President Ronald Reagan had a close friendship as this photo from the White House shows. Thatcher said, "As soon as I met \[then\] Governor Reagan, I knew that we were of like mind, and manifestly so did he. We shared a rather unusual philosophy and we shared something else rather unusual as well: We were in politics because we wanted to put our philosophy into practice."

## The Actress Who Would Be A Princess

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/9-1518012933108-1.jpg) 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/akmk71) This is Grace Kelly lounging around on a beach in Jamaica in 1954. The actress, who starred in Hitchcock's _Rear Window,_ would end up marrying Prince Ranier III and become the Princess of Monaco. Thus she cemented her legacy as one of the best-loved stars of all time.

## Before There Was Disneyland

This is a young-ish Walt Disney showing off his plans for Disneyland live on TV in 1954. A year later, the park would open its doors for the very first time. This photo was actually colorized after the fact, and would have been originally captured in black and white.

## A Present For Adolf Hitler

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/11-1518013131288-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.cl/pin/689684130408433600/) Here are two American servicemen celebrating Easter during World War II by making presents for Adolf Hitler. Yes, these are live munitions that these two fine gentlemen were painting, and yes, they're intended to be "delivered" to the worst dictator in history. Sadly, Hitler would die by his own hand rather than by one of these gifts placed under his tree.

## John Lennon Drops In On Happy Days

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12-1518013218006-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/573012752559638450/) This may be the first and only time that Fonzie wasn't the coolest guy on _Happy Days_. While Henry Winkler may have been the greatest star on the show, there's no doubt that John Lennon was one of the few people on earth at that time capable of upstaging him. Supposedly, they got along very well during the visit.

## The Ultimate In Frigid Luxury

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13a-1518014027059-1.jpg) 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Spoopapodcast) If you've ever wondered what life on the Titanic might have been like before it sunk beneath the icy waves never to be seen again, it looked like this. This is the interior of a cabin on the doomed transatlantic liner. Even today, it looks opulent and distinguished. Back then it must have blown people's minds.

## An Unpleasant Moment For Someone

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/14a-1518014091559-1.jpg) 

[Blogberth](https://history.blogberth.com/2017/07/27/a-public-hanging-in-mississippi-c-1900-x-via-reddit/) This is an image of a public execution. These were commonplace in the United States for many years and indeed, the last public hanging was in 1936 of Rainey Bethea, a convicted rapist and murderer. Only a few U.S. states still have the death penalty, and all of them now require a private execution.

## When Two Presidents Meet

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/15-1518014172389-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/404761085251870269/) Presidents Truman and Eisenhower look to be much friendlier during this car ride than they actually were. Eisenhower had just refused to enter the White House where President-Elect Truman had just taken residence and the limo journey was a compromise that made neither man happy. They disliked each other's stances on foreign policy and never saw eye to eye.

## The Craziest Fans In History

This is a shot of two girls embroiled in "Beatlemania," the term applied to fanatical worshippers of the pop group The Beatles. Justin Bieber may be popular today, but his Beliebers have nothing on Beatlemania. Young women mobbed and stalked the group wherever they went in the world. One venue reported finding 40 pairs of ladies' underwear after a visit from the Liverpudlian quartet.

## Carrie Fisher Appears In Rolling Stone

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/17-1518013398063-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/241013017539446657/?lp=true) This image once published in Rolling Stone was meant to promote _Return of the Jedi._ In actuality, it promoted one of the movie's stars, Carrie Fisher. She tragically passed away last year, but she will always be remembered for her iconic look and the brilliance she brought to the big screen.

## A Young Walt Disney

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/18-1518013308751-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.cl/pin/230316968417214029/) Walt Disney wasn't always in the theme park business. In fact, during World War I, he longed to join the army. But he was too young, so he signed up for the Red Cross Ambulance Corp instead. He served in Paris, supporting military operations as a medic until returning to the United States after the war.

## The USA Drinking Team!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/19-1518012876247-1.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/448882287835961373/) No, the USA has never had a drinking team. Though it's a nice idea and we certainly know a few writers who could try out if it did happen. These are just two ladies having fun back in the 1960s. They look ready to try and drink for their country. That's what it's all about, right?

## Alice Cooper Meets Colonel Sanders Of KFC

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20-1518012809489-1.jpg) 

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/5lb3wb/colonel_sanders_and_alice_cooper_1969/) Alice Cooper said of their meeting; “Here comes this nice old man in a white suit, suddenly I realize that this is the Hannibal Lecter of chickens. I have the death of exactly one chicken on my hands, and this guy has a score of 10 billion. Yet everyone loves this guy, and hates me for being a chicken killer! The irony of the two of us being in the same room at the same time was not lost on either me or the Colonel.”

## Debbie Harry Is Atomic For Blondie

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4a-1518013687521-1.jpg) 

[Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/92jY1) Debbie Harry was the darling of the music scene in the late 1970s, and here you can see her live and at her best. Interestingly, some claim she was the first ever female rapper to score a number one hit because of her song "Rapture." Blondie, her band, has sold over 40 million records to date.

## The Model On The Moon

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6a-1518013825982-1.jpg) 

[Blogspot](http://yargb.blogspot.com/2012/10/) Okay, she didn't go to the moon, but this young lady is Miss NASA 1971. Yes, the science geeks had their own beauty contest for at least five years from 1968 to 1973. Oddly, nobody seems to know who won in 1972, and there's no photograph of the winner known to exist either.
