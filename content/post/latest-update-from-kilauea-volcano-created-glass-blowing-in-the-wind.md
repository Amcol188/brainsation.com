Unless you're a vulcanologist, you probably haven't heard the term "Pele's hair" before now, but it's another one of the interesting, awe inspiring, and deadly natural phenomena that's a result of Kilauea's eruption in Hawaii.

[Pele's Hair - USGS](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/multimedia_chronology.html) Pele's hair refers to the fine strands of volcanic glass that are blowing in the wind around that rumbling Hawaiian volcano. Here's more from [HawaiiNewsNow.com](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38299856/peles-hair-an-interesting-sight-but-officials-say-stay-away): _It’s certainly a perplexing sight as its appearance does resemble strands of golden hair, but officials warn that the public should stay away. As lava bursts and fountains from one of the fissures in Leilani Estates, it produces Pele’s hair through the stretching or blowing-out of molten basaltic glass. Officials say the wind has been picking up the volcanic glass and moving it downwind and to the west of the fissure. On Monday night, residents reported Pele’s hair falling in Pahoa.

[Pele's Hair - USGS](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/multimedia_chronology.html) The National Weather Service says Pele’s hair, which is abrasive, can cause skin and eye irritation similar to volcanic ash. This is the latest hazard arising from the Kilauea eruptions that began on May 3. In addition to high levels of sulfur dioxide gas being detected near the fissures, lava flows from several fissures have been entering the ocean, creating a toxic mix of lava and haze called "laze." And, explosive eruptions at the summit of Kilauea have also been creating ash plumes that have sent emissions to nearby communities. _ The glass gets its name from Pele, the Fire Goddess in Hawaiian religion. She is the goddess of fire, lightning, wind, volcanoes and, as legend has it, the creator of the Hawaiian Islands. In other news from Hawaii, experts are increasing their efforts to evacuate locals near the volcano as fast moving lava continues to spread across the island.

 [Pele's Hair - USGS](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/multimedia_chronology.html) Again from [Hawaii News Now](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38292624/fast-moving-lava-threatens-major-road-geothermal-plant-in-lower-puna): _A fast-moving lava flow, spewing fountains more than 200 feet into the air, is making its way through lower Puna, sparking immediate evacuations as it covers major roads and threatens more homes in the area. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials alerted residents in the Kapoho area, including Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacation Lots, to evacuate as the fast-moving lava flow near Highway 132 picked up speed and advanced toward the area. The flow is threatening to cut off Beach Road, the only remaining access point out of the area._
