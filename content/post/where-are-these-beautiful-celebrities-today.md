We all remember these vixens from the 80's and 90's.  They were beautiful celebrities starring in our favorite movies and TV shows.  Over the years they have fallen out of the spotlight.  But we are here to track them down for you and show how they have aged over the years.  Some for better, some for tragically worse.

## Kelly McGillis

We fell in love with her in the 80's as Maverick's brainy beau, Charlie Blackwood, in 'Top Gun.'  Not going to lie, I had a major crush on her after seeing that movie.  After seeing her now? Not so much!
