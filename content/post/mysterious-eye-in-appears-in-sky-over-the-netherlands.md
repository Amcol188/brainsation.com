The sky above the Netherlands on April 22 was the typical cloudy setting that natives are used to around this time of year. One thing that was not typical was an unusual cloud formation that had people offering various interpretations of what was being seen. **One Eye Open** The [UK’s Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/951311/End-of-the-world-2018-sign-eye-in-the-sky-bible) reports that on the aforementioned date a “monstrous eye in the sky” made from clouds appeared in the heavens.

The Bible, reports the Express, states in Luke Chapter 21 that just before the beginning of the End Times there would be “signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars” as a warning. Video of the event, posted by MrMBB333 onto YouTube, is entitled “Just down right ‘strange’ sky observations” and includes a variety of bizarre formations and events in the sky.

Diana M Pfeiffer, @SongofSeaphim, tweeted: “A reminder that God is always watching.” Clifford Roebuck wrote on YouTube: “It's like somebody's got an eye on Earth.” Claudia Romae offered that the eye looks “like the All Seeing Eye on our Dollar bills, Egyptian stones, etc.” Travis Gillette posted: “Looks like both you and her might have caught some of the war in heaven. “I’ve seen several battles already, but mighty Michael and the archangels will be victorious. “And the demon clouds are getting scary. I saw a video explaining how the chemtrails are actually facilitating them. Full armour of God people.” Caroline 2017 also expressed alarm: “Extremely weird and unusual events going on. Something huge is going to happen any day.

“Stay safe. God bless you, have Jesus Christ in your hearts.” Non-religious submissions included many references to the role of the US High Frequency Active and Auroral Research Programme (HAARP) and ‘chemtrails’. Those subscribing to the HAARP theory claim that the U.S. Government uses HAARP to control weather. One of those believers, YouTube user Colt Ham, exclaimed, “That halo is shrouded in chemtrails. How much more can they spray before people wake the hell up?” Watch the video below and decide for yourself:
