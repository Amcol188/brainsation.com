If you are or ever have been a parent, you will know the wave of defeat that washes over you when you enter your child's room and see it carpeted with hundreds if not thousands of multi-colored Lego pieces or you may have had the 'pleasure' of stepping on the sharp-edged tokens of torture in the middle of the night.

A story in [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a20198728/this-lego-breakfast-machine-can-make-you-bacon-and-eggs/),for instance, proves that patience can be rewarding. A YouTuber going by the handle 'The Brick Wall' has posted a video of an ingenious Lego-contraption that can cook up breakfast.

[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/lego-build-building-blocks-toys-708088/) Referred to as the Breakfast Machine, the Rube Goldberg-esque device consists of an egg cracker that taps and splits the shelled goody and disposes of the remains. Then a 'spatula car' is used to move the eggs and bacon around the fryer. When the cooking is done, a claw holds the egg while the device transports it to a plate where the Breakfast Machine can then add salt and pepper if desired.

"My father cooks breakfast every Saturday and Sunday – it is 104 times a year! He deserved this present," the Breakfast Machine creator, [The Brick Wall](https://www.facebook.com/Thebrickwalllego), writes.

According to the creator, the hardest part of the design was tweaking the device just right so that it dropped the egg onto the fryer, but not the shell.

"I spent almost a week working on the right mechanism."

The answer was found in using small metal blades to hold the shell in place. The contraption is covered in clear tape to not only protect the Lego pieces from contamination, but to make clean up easier too.

He has built a "[Lego Roomba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COOVF0RuaMM)consisting of 986 parts (including a tiny Lego pilot) that can sweep up Lego pieces scattered around a room, and a functioning [Lego harvesting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1QboGTzvE) that can cut up sprigs of spring onion, and pick up tomatoes and apples."
