“My daughter is the smartest person I know,” said the iconic actor. “When I don’t know something, that’s who I call.”

Dustin Hoffman’s youngest child from his marriage to Lisa Hoffman definitely prefers life outside the glare of the spotlight.

Alexandra recently made headlines for her brief fling with Jonah Hill, but she’s since gone back to living the quiet life after their breakup.

“Fame has its perks for sure,” she said. “But like anything, there is a downside. I saw how isolating it could be for my father. Sometimes he just wanted to go to the grocery store and be normal, but that just wasn’t an option.”

Can you imagine what Richie Sambora and Heather Locklear’s daughter Ava looks like?

Trust us when we say she’s drop dead gorgeous…
