The age of mechanical devices performing programmed tasks has given way to the reign of the autonomous robot. Last year, Boston Dynamics released video of its four-legged robot called SpotMini. In the video, the robot showed how it could open and close doors, even holding it for open for others. When a human tried to prevent SpotMini from opening the door by swatting at its mechanical arm, the dog-like robot tried to continue with its task until it basically fought off the human.

[Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-demonstration/) The humanoid version of SpotMini is Atlas, a two-legged, two-armed headless automaton that has amazed crowds with its ability to walk, go up and down stairs and even perform a backflip. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/10/17341400/boston-dynamics-atlas-spotmini-robots-videos-autonomous-navigation) writes that new videos have been released showing some new abilities for SpotMini and his ‘master’ Atlas. One shows Atlas out for a daylight jog across a grassy yard with some slopes and rises. Atlas ran the stretch without any recorded problems.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY) When Atlas comes upon a log, it pauses and then jumps over the obstacle. The Verge comments that the vaulting is not too impressive in style, but the robot does clear the log and manages to stay on its own two feet. That is impressive.

 [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) SpotMini makes a return appearance in another video displaying how the dogbot can climb up and down stairs. In an act of full disclosure, Boston Dynamics does relate how human handlers had to first walk SpotMini through the course so the robot could map out the environs. It is amazing how quickly advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are occurring. This is why readers should stay tuned to Brainsation for daily updates for all things science and tech.
