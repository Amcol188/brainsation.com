Over the years, there are those animals that have continued to steal the top position among the deadliest animals in the world. Although you cannot rule them out, there’s more to it than just brawn, large teeth, and venom defensive mechanisms when it comes to categorizing the most life-threatening creatures on the earth and in water. You think sharks, lions, and elephants are deadliest animals? You're dead wrong. Some of the little creatures that you find cute and probably been playing around with are surprisingly extremely dangerous. Stumbling on some of these animals will cause serious illnesses or even instant death. Here’s our list of the most dangerous animals the world over.
