The daughter of Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston normally goes by her stage name, Taylor Dearden.

“I really wanted to succeed on my own terms,” said Dearden. “And that means not trading on my father’s good name. I want to inspire and entertain, not ride on coattails.”

The two have previously worked together in one episode of Breaking Bad, after which she’s gone on to appear in a number of television series and short films.
