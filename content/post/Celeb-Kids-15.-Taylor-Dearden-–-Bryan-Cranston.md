The daughter of Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston normally goes by her stage name, Taylor Dearden.

“I really wanted to succeed on my own terms,” said Dearden. “And that means not trading on my father’s good name. I want to inspire and entertain, not ride on coattails.”

The two have previously worked together in one episode of Breaking Bad, after which she’s gone on to appear in a number of television series and short films.

In 2016, Dearden was cast in the MTV program Sweet/Vicious where she played the character of Ophelia Mayer.

The show was critically acclaimed for its portrayal of campus sexual assault, but unfortunately, didn’t last long.

Despite being beloved by critics, with Dearden’s work positively reviewed, Sweet/Vicious was canceled after just one season.
