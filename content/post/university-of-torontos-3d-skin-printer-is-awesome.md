What do you get when you combine a hot glue gun, a 3D printer and modern skin-grafting techniques? Why you get the sci-fi-looking contraption developed by researchers at the University of Toronto, Canada.

[Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/skin-printer-handheld-toronto/) [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/62511-skin-printer-heal-deep-wounds.html) writes that the prototype device — which weighs less than 2 lbs. (0.9 kilograms) —deposits a layer of "'bio-ink' when dragged across a surface. This ink contains materials normally present in the skin, including collagen, a protein that allows cells to grow and thrive; and fibrin, a protein that aids in blood clotting to help heal wounds." The body's largest organ, skin is far from a simple outer layer. Skin has three layers starting with the outside stratum called the epidermis, which is made up mostly od dead skin cells pushed to the surface; a middle layer called the dermis and containing collagen fibers; and the inner layer called the subcutaneous or hypodermis layer, which is made up mostly of fat.

[WebMD](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/image_article_collections/anatomy_pages/skin.jpg) Throughout the stratum of skin runs networks of cells, nerves, blood vessels and differeing kinds of hair. Taken together, skin is an effective barrier against the host of bacteria and viruses trying to enter our body. If the integrity of this barrier is in anyway compromised, like say in a severe burn, the body is susceptible to infection. This is why the Toronto 'skin gun' is such an amazing invention. The mobile device can quickly seal off damaged areas by layering them with the bio-ink containing keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but it is being planned that a future device will deposit a much more organic resin that will include stem cells, blood vessels and other cells designed to create 'perfect skin'.

[The Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/portable-3d-skin-printer-can-heal-wounds-in-minutes-study-5167125/) Amini Nik, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Toronto involcved in the project, believes that as the protoype evolves and "as we move toward precision medicine … I think the 3D printer has the potential to really spot the \[necessary\] cells and specially distribute them to make organs."
