“Mom’s light was like a blazing sun,” said singer Liza Minelli of her mother, Judy Garland. “And that made standing in her shadow quite cold. Imagine trying to sing and dance in that darkness.”

From Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s triple-threat kids, to Jon Voight’s daughter Angelina Jolie who’s joined her dad as an Oscar winner, some famous parents have passed the talent on from one generation to the next.

Oftentimes, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree with celeb parents and their talented offspring.

“But it’s not always the case that children inherit their parent’s singing or acting abilities,” said celebrity biographer James Sandy. “A pair of accomplished vocalists can produce a litter of tone-deaf, melody-adverse croakers.”

But it seems like it would be pretty great to grow up with famous parents, right?

There would be galas galore, fancy vacations, and easy access to your celebrity crush.

But according to Willow Smith, the 17-year-old daughter of Will and Jada, growing up in the public eye was “absolutely terrible.”

In a recent interview with Girlgaze, Willow opened up about what it was like to spend her teenage years in the spotlight and she didn’t hold back.

“Growing up and trying to figure out your life… while people feel like they have some sort of entitlement to know what’s going on, is absolutely, excruciatingly terrible. You can’t change your face. You can’t change your parents. You can’t change any of those things.”

Of course, it goes without saying that people are fascinated with the lives of celebrities, and consequently, their children can become headline-grabbers themselves.

“Just because a child grows up in the limelight, it doesn’t mean they want to be famous,” said Sandy. “In fact, it’s just as common to have the children resent the intrusions into their privacy. They just want to be normal sometimes.”

And as an homage to this “quest for normalcy,” we’ve compiled a list of 25 celebrity children and caught up with what they’re doing now. After scouring the internet, culling the best gossip blogs, and pouring over the Google image archives, we’ve put together a list that omits the most famous kids.

So if you’re looking for juicy details on ultra-famous offspring like Bryce Dallas Howard, Carrie Fisher, or Angelina Jolie, you’ve come to the wrong place.

This listicle is all about the kids that have super famous parents, but aren’t that interested in being famous themselves.

Or maybe they’d like to be, but up until this point, they’ve failed utterly at it!

So, without further ado, here’s our list of 25 kids with famous parents and where they’re at now…

## 1. **Marcus Jordan – Michael Jordan**

Did you know that the son of NBA legend and arguably the best basketball player of all time also shoots hoops?

Marcus Jordan played college ball for the UCF Knights, but never was able to carve out a career like his father.

When Marcus was a freshman, UCF was in the final year of a five-year contract with Adidas, but Jordan insisted on wearing Nike Air Jordan shoes out of loyalty to his father. This eventually prompted Adidas to terminate its sponsorship deal with the Knights.

“Marcus was never as skilled as his father,” said sports commentator Jonas Richards. “But then again, who is? Nobody comes close to Michael Jordan.”

In 2016, Marcus opened up a shoe store called the Trophy Room in Orlando, Florida at Disney World.

Up next we’ve got the daughter of the hilarious Mr. Bean…

## 2. Lily Atkinson – Rowan Atkinson

Lily Atkinson is the daughter of the legendary British actor, comedian, and writer Rowan Atkinson and his wife, Sunetra Sastry.

Although Lily is currently 22-years-old, she has been composing, singing, and dancing since she was five!

Raised in a tip-top segment of London, she went to a exclusive private school with the offspring of many other famous brits.

She is said to be a very capable equestrian, and during her high school years, spent some six hours a day riding.

She recently made headlines for launching a fairly raunchy cabaret, about which her father has kept mum in the press.

Up next we’ve got Reese Witherspoon’s doppleganger daughter, Ava…

## 3. Ava Phillippe – Reese Witherspoon

![](/uploads/3.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/3/)

No, you’re not looking at two photos of Reese Witherspoon!

The one on the left is Miss “Legally Blonde” herself, and the cute little toddler she’s holding is none other than her daughter with Ryan Phillippe, Ava.

But what about the gal on the right?

That’s Ava today, now that she’s all grown up!

And just recently, she starred in the lookbook for Rodarte’s 2018 Fall collection alongside Black Panther star Danai Gurira, Hong Chau, Tessa Thompson and Kirsten Dunst.

Despite her preference for privacy and a low profile, it’s obvious Ava was born to be Hollywood royalty.

> “When people dream of being famous, they don’t really understand what they’re wishing for,” said Ava. “It’s like what foreigners think about the United States before they move here. The thing itself and the idea of the thing are too completely different animals.”

Up next we’ve got Billy Joel’s daughter, Alexa Ray…

## 4. Alexa Ray Joel – Billy Joel & Christie Brinkley

![](/uploads/4-1.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/4/)

Born to Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, it’s no wonder that Alexa Ray Joel has grown into an extremely beautiful woman.

She’s also taken after her parents’ career choices, having dabbled in both the music and fashion industries.

“I was raised in a pretty old-fashioned way, believe it or not,” the 32-year-old recently told Closer Weekly. “Literally, if I didn’t say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to the waiter, I’d get a little tap on the shoulder.”

And while her parents divorced when she was just 8 years old, Joel said she never rebelled during her teenage years.

“I hear how Drew Barrymore grew up going to the bars — I was never allowed,” said Joel. “I was sheltered.”

Up next is Alexandra Hoffman and her famous daddy, Dustin…

## 5. Alexandra Hoffman – Dustin Hoffman

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/5/)

“My daughter is the smartest person I know,” said the iconic actor. “When I don’t know something, that’s who I call.”

Dustin Hoffman’s youngest child from his marriage to Lisa Hoffman definitely prefers life outside the glare of the spotlight.

Alexandra recently made headlines for her brief fling with Jonah Hill, but she’s since gone back to living the quiet life after their breakup.

“Fame has its perks for sure,” she said. “But like anything, there is a downside. I saw how isolating it could be for my father. Sometimes he just wanted to go to the grocery store and be normal, but that just wasn’t an option.”

Can you imagine what Richie Sambora and Heather Locklear’s daughter Ava looks like?

Trust us when we say she’s drop dead gorgeous…

## 6. Ava Sambora – Richie Sambora & Heather Locklear

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/6/)

Bon Jovi’s guitarist Richie Sambora struck glittering gold when he managed to snag Heather Locklear.

While their marriage only lasted for 13 years, it resulted in the precious gem that is known as Ava Sambora.

Having recently turned 19, Ava definitely takes after her mother in the looks department.

And her modeling career, which has included stints with Tommy Hilfiger and Guess, appears to be trending nowhere but up.

“Both mother and daughter have that movie star quality,” said Bon Jovi. “That’s a rare thing. You can’t learn that and you can’t acquire it. It’s a gift.”

Up next we’ve got the late Crocodile Hunter and his conservationist daughter, Bindi Irwin…

## 7. Bindi Irwin – Steve Irwin

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/7/)

Although Steve Irwin shuffled off this mortal coil much too soon, he managed to leave a lasting mark on this world, with his gorgeous daughter intent on following in his footsteps.

But Binidi isn’t the only child of Steve and Terri Irwin.

Her younger brother is Robert Irwin, a television personality and photographer.

Bindi has been involved in acting, singing, dancing, rapping, game show hosting, and has created two instructional fitness DVDs.

She is also known for winning season 21 of Dancing with the Stars.

And next we’ve got the fabulous son of basketball legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson…

## 8. Earvin “EJ” Johnson III – Earvin “Magic” Johnson Jr.

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/8/)

“We are talking about people who are not afraid to live their truth,” Earvin said at a Beautycon interview. “That is what beauty is all about, because it’s in the eye of the beholder, honey.”

Despite growing up in Hollywood, the son of “Magic” Johnson lived a relatively quiet life until he was outed by TMZ.

Although he first came out to his family as a teenager, the public wasn’t aware of his sexual orientation until an expose on the gossip show broke the news.

In 2014, Johnson became a recurring cast member during the first season of the E! reality series Rich Kids of Beverly Hills.

When the show was canceled after four years, Johnson launched his own spin-off titled EJNYC, the first reality series to profile a young LGBTQ person of color.

And next we’ve got Clint Eastwood and his smoking hot daughter Francesca…

## 9. Francesca Eastwood – Clint Eastwood

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/9/)

Whereas Clint Eastwood was known for being the ultimate badass during his heyday, his daughter has channeled that Eastwood swag into serious blonde bombshell territory.

The 23-year-old model and actress, who has done a fair amount of both, seems to be focused on being a socialite these days.

Eastwood first appeared on the reality television series Mrs. Eastwood & Company when it premiered in May of 2012. It focused on the lives of Francesca, her stepmother Dina Eastwood, and her half-sister Morgan.

During one episode, Francesca and her boyfriend Tyler Shields were filmed destroying a $100,000 Hermès purse during a photo shoot.

“I got death threats over that,” she remarked. “People are insane.”

Up next we’ve got the quintessential 90s grunge rocker and his artist daughter…

## 10. Frances Bean Cobain – Kurt Cobain & Courtney Love

_![](/uploads/10.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/10/)

Frances Bean Cobain spent much of her childhood being raised by different people.

Having been taken by child protective services when she was just two weeks old, Frances Bean knows a thing or two about resilience.

“I don’t blame my parents for the mistakes they made,” she said. “I’m actually a stronger person for it. I can see that now.”

After her father died, Frances spent years bouncing between her mother, aunts, and her paternal grandmother.

But despite her “less than ideal” childhood, she grew up to be a fine woman and a talented artist.

She regularly opens critically-acclaimed shows that feature her original paintings, sculptures, and installations.

Frances, who has also appeared in various fashion magazines over the years, is worth an estimated $170 million and has a “good relationship” with her mother now.

Up next we’ve got the daughter of legendary rocker Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall…

## 11. Georgia May Jagger – Mick Jagger & Jerry Hall

_![](/uploads/11.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/11/)

Although Jerry Hall was one of the most successful models of the 1970s, it was her marriage to Mick Jagger that catapulted her into the upper echelons of fame and fortune.

The couple’s daughter, Georgia May Jagger, seems to intent to follow in her mother’s Gucci-clad footsteps.

Having been signed by Independent Models at age 16, Georgia May has appeared in dozens of campaigns for well-known brands, such as Miu Miu and Chanel.

“I suppose I’m famous to some degree,” the 25-year-old told GQ. “But I’m really just a regular person who loves clothes.”

## 12. Simone Alexandra Johnson – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson

_![](/uploads/rock.jpg)_[_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/12/)

Simone Alexandra Johnson is the daughter of wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Although she can often be seen with her father attending award shows, Simone likes to keep a low profile.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, “The Rock” stated that he is blessed to have a daughter like Simone.

“I’m so proud of Simone for keeping her private life private,” her father said. “She’s such a mature girl for her age.”

Simone is fairly popular on social media and her Instagram account boasts more than 250,000 followers.

She made headlines recently when she was signed by IMG Models, an international leader in talent acquisition and model management.

And next we’ve got one of the best looking men to ever grace the silver screen and his equally handsome son…

## 13. John Lowe – Rob Lowe

_![](/uploads/lowe.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/13/)

At 53, Rob Lowe is old enough to be his son John’s grandfather, and yet, the handsome duo can frequently be seen working out together.

“There comes a time in everybody’s life when they have to set off and make a name for themselves,” the 21-year-old recently told Ellen Degeneres.

And apparently, John Owen Lowe is ready for the spotlight with his new A&E show, The Lowe Files.

But this isn’t John’s first foray into show business.

John Owen starred on his dear old dad’s show The Grinder as Joel Zadak from 2015 to 2016.

He and his older brother, Matthew, have also made numerous appearances on daytime talk shows and entertainment programs including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The View, and Entertainment Tonight.

Following his debut on The Grinder, John confirmed to the Sioux City Journal that he planned on following in his father’s footsteps, saying, “At first it was just a fun thing to try, but now I’m enjoying it so much I think I’ve got the bug.”

And next we’ve got a pair of gorgeous and talented redheads…

## 14. Liv Freundlich – Julianne Moore

_![](/uploads/12.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/14/)

Julianne Moore continues to age gracefully as she approaches her late fifties, but despite the actress’ age, she could easily be mistaken for her daughter’s sister.

And while Liv has her mother to thank for her good looks, she clearly has her father Bart Freundlich to thank for her height.

Julianne recently told the Huffington Post, “She’s just her own person. What’s amazing is how quickly that happens. My mother said, about me and my sister and brother, ‘You are who you are. You aren’t any different from the day you were born.’ I remembered that distinctly when my kids were born, because they came with very specific temperaments.”

And for her part, Julianne is a hands-on mom, telling the Daily Telegraph that her kids “live a regular life.”

“I make breakfast for them, my husband drives them to school, and we all go to basketball games,” she said.

And next we’ve got Brian Cranston’s daughter, Taylor…

## 15. Taylor Dearden – Bryan Cranston

_![](/uploads/13.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/15/)

The daughter of Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston normally goes by her stage name, Taylor Dearden.

“I really wanted to succeed on my own terms,” said Dearden. “And that means not trading on my father’s good name. I want to inspire and entertain, not ride on coattails.”

The two have previously worked together in one episode of Breaking Bad, after which she’s gone on to appear in a number of television series and short films.

In 2016, Dearden was cast in the MTV program Sweet/Vicious where she played the character of Ophelia Mayer.

The show was critically acclaimed for its portrayal of campus sexual assault, but unfortunately, didn’t last long.

Despite being beloved by critics, with Dearden’s work positively reviewed, Sweet/Vicious was canceled after just one season.

Yep, there’s three of ’em…

## 16. Dakota Johnson – Don Johnson & Melanie Griffith

##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/16/)

You know, there was once a time when Dakota Johnson was simply known as the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. These days, however, she’s just as famous as her parents, if not even more so.

Thanks in part to her role as Anastasia Steele in the hit novel-turned-movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Antonio Banderas’ stepdaughter has really made a name for herself.

Johnson was primarily raised in Aspen and Woody Creek, Colorado, where she worked at the local grocery store as a young teenager.

Though acting keeps her pretty busy these days, she has also modeled for MANGO brand jeans in 2009 and Australian fashion house Wish in 2011.

Remember rocker Lenny Kravitz and Cosby Show alum Lisa Bonet?

Well, their daughter is all grown up and doing some pretty big things…

## 17. Zoë Kravitz – Lenny Kravitz & Lisa Bonet

_![](/uploads/15.jpg)_[_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/17/)

There’s no denying that Zoë won the genetic lottery with both of her startlingly good-looking parents. Having grown up to become a sought-after actress, she’s been burning up the silver screen in movies like X-Men: First Class and Mad Max: Fury Road.

Kravitz’s parents married in 1987 and divorced six years later when Zoë was five. She initially lived with her mother in Topanga Canyon, and then moved to Miami at age eleven to be with her father.

Aside from acting, Kravitz was the face of Vera Wang’s Princess fragrance in 2009, and has modeled for Venus Zine and Elle, among others.

She also fronts the band Lolawolf, who released their debut album Calm Down in 2014.

The band has toured with Lily Allen, Miley Cyrus, and other big name acts.

Up next it’s Sly Stallone and his model daughter, Sistine…

## 18. Sistine Stallone – Sylvester Stallone

_![](/uploads/16-1.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/18/)

Sistine Stallone, Sylvester Stallone’s middle child, has managed to carve out a burgeoning modeling career for herself after signing with IMG.

“To my surprise, my dad has been very supportive of my work,” she said. “He and my mom did a good job of keeping us away from the public eye. Now, he’s like, ‘This is your moment. Mine is over, and I want it to be about you.'”

Unlike her father, Sistine has said many times that she enjoys modeling much more than acting.

“It’s just a different vibe,” she said. “And I’m very visually expressive. I like to inhabit the clothes and let them make me feel a certain way. With acting, you become a different person. With modeling, you become a different version of yourself.”

And next we’ve got Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick’s daughter, Sosie.

They tried their best to keep her sheltered and out of the limelight, but…

## 19. Sosie Bacon – Kevin Bacon & Kyra Sedgwick

_![](/uploads/17.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/19/)

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick tried their best to keep their daughter Sosie far away from the flashing lights of Hollywood while she was growing up.

“We just know how hard this industry is,” said Kevin Bacon. “And we didn’t want her to get caught up in all the crazy stuff that goes on.”

However, it seems like the proverbial apple didn’t fall very far from the tree.

Although her parents were initially opposed to her pursing an acting career, Sosie accepted a role in The Closer and appeared in four episodes alongside her mother, who played the role of Chief Johnson.

Sosie also portrayed the character of Skye Miller in the TV series 13 Reasons Why.

And next we’ve got Jude Law and his handsome son, Rafferty…

## 20. Rafferty Law – Jude Law

_![](/uploads/18.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/20/)

Rafferty Law definitely has a lot to thank his father for when it comes to his looks, which the 20-year-old has used to kick-start a career as a singer and model.

With 33,000 Instagram followers, Raff (as he is often called) is a well-known face on runways, a producer of his own music, and one of the founders of the creative collective Something to Hate On.

“He’s been musical since he was a kid,” said father Jude. “He would drag all the pots and pans out from the kitchen cabinets and bang on those all day long.”

Raff attributes his passion for music to his parents “playing wicked music from a young age.”

According to the younger Law, he grew up listening to the Beatles, Nirvana, and Madonna.

“Madge is actually my favorite,” he told GQ. “Her catalogue is really diverse. I strive to have that sort of range and creativity.”

And next we’ve got two of the most famous people on the planet and their passionately private son, Connor…

## 21. Connor Cruise – Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman

_![](/uploads/19.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/21/)

They were the prototypical power couple of the 1990s.

Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise adopted two children, Isabella and Connor Anthony, during their 11-year marriage. And while Connor has managed to stay out of the spotlight and more importantly, out of the Hollywood gossip rags, much of his life has been spent in the shadow of his uber-famous parents.

Connor lives in Clearwater, Florida near the headquarters of the Church of Scientology.

His father, long a prominent member, has been renovating a penthouse nearby to be his “new home base.” Though Connor used to DJ, he now spends much of his time deep-sea fishing and even competed in the sport earlier this year.

“Connor has a pretty simple life in Clearwater,” a source recently told People magazine. “He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.”

And next, here’s Andy Garcia’s daughter Dominik…

## 22. Dominik Cristina Garcia-Lorido – Andy Garcia

_![](/uploads/20.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/22/)

The eldest of Andy Garcia’s four children, Dominik dreamt of being a dancer when she was a little girl. These days, however, she has been focusing on getting her acting career off the ground.

Unfortunately, though, she hasn’t been that successful.

Dominik most recently appeared in the Simon West-directed 2015 thriller Wild Card. Starring alongside Jason Statham and Michael Angarano, Dominik’s performance was not well received.

“Andy Garcia’s daughter was absolutely terrible,” said film critic Stephen Jameson. “There were times when it seemed like she was reading her lines off of a cue card. Her raunchy moves as Holly, the prostitute, were believable.”

Wild Card was a box office bomb, making only $6.7 million internationally against a $30 million budget.

And next we’ve got Sean Penn’s daughter, Dylan…

## 23. Dylan Penn – Sean Penn & Robin Wright

_![](/uploads/21.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/23/)

The daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright has created a successful modeling career, but not before going through a few hardships.

Dylan attended Marin Academy and dropped out of the University of Southern California after one semester. Her parents’ divorce was finalized in 2010.

And before modeling, Penn had worked delivering pizzas, as a waitress, and as a freelance screenplay editor.

She also worked in New York City as a restaurant hostess and an intern at an advertising agency.

In April of 2014, Penn posed for a partially nude cover and interior layout in the seventh issue of the erotica magazine Treats.

Curiously, her father said that he had “always loved Dylan’s black-and-white nudes.”

Uh, moving right along…

Next we’ve got “The Hoff” and his daughter Haley…

## 24. Haley Hasselhoff – David Hasselhoff

_![](/uploads/22.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/25/)

David Hasselhoff and Pamela Bach’s 7-year marriage resulted in two children, one of which was Hayley.

The youngest Hasselhoff daughter gained public notoriety when she appeared in the 2010 reality series The Hasselhoffs, but Haley was no stranger to the small screen even then.

She had previously made a guest appearance in the 1990s on Baywatch.

Hasselhoff has been modeling as a plus-size model since she was only 14-years-old.

At one point, she was signed with Wilhelmina Models and as of 2014, works exclusively with Ford Models.

Up next we’ve got the Hell’s Kitchen devil himself and his son, Jack…

## 25. Jack Scott Ramsay – Gordon Ramsay

_![](/uploads/23.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/26/)

Known for his brutal, yet incredibly entertaining honesty, Gordon Ramsay has a slew of successful restaurants in the United Kingdom, several popular television shows, and “a mouth like a \[expletive\] sailor.”

Recently, the celebrity chef extraordinaire revealed he won’t be passing his fortune down to his four children, despite reportedly earning as much as Beyonce.

According to Forbes, Ramsay earned $54 million last year alone.

He and his wife, Tana, have agreed that their kids, including twins Jack and Holly, will each get a 25% deposit on a flat.

“But that’s the end of our generosity,” said Tana Ramsay. “They will have to work and earn their successes for themselves.”

Jack, age 17, who’s off to attend university early next year, better study hard.

“There are no blank checks in this house,” added Gordon Ramsay.

And next we’ve got the the Terminator’s illegitimate son, Joseph Baena…

## 26. Joseph Baena – Arnold Schwarzenegger

_![](/uploads/24.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/28/)

Joseph Baena, the result of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s affair with his housekeeper Mildred Baena, was kept in the dark for many years.

However, since the dissolution of the action star’s marriage to Maria Shriver, Arnold has been more public and open about his son.

Recently, the two have been spotted spending lots of time together, with Joseph looking a lot like his father when he was younger.

“The rest of the kids are really taking to him,” said gossip blogger Perez Hilton. “He’s just another member of the family now.”

Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy “started looking like \[him\]… that \[he\] put things together.”

And last but not least, we’ve got the daughter of Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman…

## 27. Lucy DeVito – Danny DeVito & Rhea Perlman

_![](/uploads/25-1.jpg)
##### [_Image Credit_](http://americanupbeat.com/kids-of-famous-parents-where-are-they-now/29/)

As is expected with most celebrity kids, DeVito and Perlman’s daughter Lucy followed her parents’ footsteps.

But unlike many untalented celeb offspring, Lucy DeVito has some serious acting chops and a real flair for comedy.

She has made appearances in DeadBeat, as well as a hilarious turn in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

In 2008, DeVito starred as Anne Frank in a production of Anne Frank at the Intiman Theatre in Seattle, Washington, to critical acclaim.
