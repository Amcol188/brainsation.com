“Mom’s light was like a blazing sun,” said singer Liza Minelli of her mother, Judy Garland. “And that made standing in her shadow quite cold. Imagine trying to sing and dance in that darkness.”

From Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s triple-threat kids, to Jon Voight’s daughter Angelina Jolie who’s joined her dad as an Oscar winner, some famous parents have passed the talent on from one generation to the next.

Oftentimes, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree with celeb parents and their talented offspring.

“But it’s not always the case that children inherit their parent’s singing or acting abilities,” said celebrity biographer James Sandy. “A pair of accomplished vocalists can produce a litter of tone-deaf, melody-adverse croakers.”

But it seems like it would be pretty great to grow up with famous parents, right?

There would be galas galore, fancy vacations, and easy access to your celebrity crush.

But according to Willow Smith, the 17-year-old daughter of Will and Jada, growing up in the public eye was “absolutely terrible.”

In a recent interview with Girlgaze, Willow opened up about what it was like to spend her teenage years in the spotlight and she didn’t hold back.

“Growing up and trying to figure out your life… while people feel like they have some sort of entitlement to know what’s going on, is absolutely, excruciatingly terrible. You can’t change your face. You can’t change your parents. You can’t change any of those things.”

Of course, it goes without saying that people are fascinated with the lives of celebrities, and consequently, their children can become headline-grabbers themselves.

“Just because a child grows up in the limelight, it doesn’t mean they want to be famous,” said Sandy. “In fact, it’s just as common to have the children resent the intrusions into their privacy. They just want to be normal sometimes.”

And as an homage to this “quest for normalcy,” we’ve compiled a list of 25 celebrity children and caught up with what they’re doing now. After scouring the internet, culling the best gossip blogs, and pouring over the Google image archives, we’ve put together a list that omits the most famous kids.

So if you’re looking for juicy details on ultra-famous offspring like Bryce Dallas Howard, Carrie Fisher, or Angelina Jolie, you’ve come to the wrong place.

This listicle is all about the kids that have super famous parents, but aren’t that interested in being famous themselves.

Or maybe they’d like to be, but up until this point, they’ve failed utterly at it!

So, without further ado, here’s our list of 25 kids with famous parents and where they’re at now…
