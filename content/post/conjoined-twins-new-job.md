### The twins recently announced that they had found work as part-time elementary school teachers.

“We are fourth- and fifth-grade math specialists, so we’ll have two classes of math," said Abby.

"It’s part time, which is nice, so we’ll be kind of transitioning into the teaching world,” Brittany added.

### As they embark on their working life together, the twins aim to take things day by day and keep their expectations to a minimum.

With their position as teachers, they have become role models for children academically, but also in their attitude to life.

"I don't think there's anything that they won't try or something that they couldn't be able to do if they really wanted to," says Paul Good, principal of the school where Abby and Brittany work.

But not everyone was quite so thrilled about the Hensel twins taking a teaching gig...
