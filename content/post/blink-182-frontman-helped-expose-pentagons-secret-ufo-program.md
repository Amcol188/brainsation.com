Music fans know Tom DeLonge as the frontman for the rock band Blink 182 but in the world of paranormal investigations, he's a rock star of a whole different kind. It seems that since he was a teenager, DeLonge has been obsessed with UFO's and the paranormal. In fact, when he got the money from his first big record contract, DeLonge used the funds to buy a computer so that he could research the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life. Heck, he's even co-written a 700 page novel about UFO's. His biggest feat, however, may be uncovering the Pentagon's secret UFO program.

 [91x.com](http://www.91x.com/adam/tom-delonge-releasing-non-fiction-book-detailing-ufo-findings/) That was done largely in part to DeLonge's latest business venture, To The Stars Academy. From [Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/ufos-are-suddenly-a-serious-news-story-you-can-thank-the-guy-from-blink-182-for-that-1.530224): At a launch event for To The Stars Academy in Seattle last fall, he explained that he was expanding his small entertainment venture — which has mostly published his graphic novels and books about UFOs and the paranormal — into a far more ambitious scientific operation, to explore "the most controversial secret on Earth." For his advisory board, DeLonge recruited physicists, aerospace experts, and former Department of Defense officials. Remember the "What the f--- is that thing?" video of a Navy pilot tracking a UFO that looked like a high speed Tic Tac? DeLonge and his group were behind the efforts to get that tape released to the public.

Screen Grab One of the people on DeLonge's advisory board is Luis Elizondo, the former director of a secret UFO program at the Pentagon. Again from [Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/news/us/ufos-are-suddenly-a-serious-news-story-you-can-thank-the-guy-from-blink-182-for-that-1.530224): "The phenomenon is indeed real," Elizondo said when it was his turn to speak. Just days before, the 22-year Defense Department veteran had submitted a resignation letter to the Pentagon, citing its disregard of "overwhelming evidence" that unexplained phenomena have been interfering with the U.S. military. Elizondo had overseen the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, quietly created in 2007 by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, D-Nev., with the encouragement of a reclusive Nevada billionaire named Robert Bigelow.

 [ToTheStarsAcademy.com](https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/) Like DeLonge, Bigelow made his fortune through earthly pursuits (real estate) but was fascinated by the otherworldly; he had funded research into crop and cattle mutilations. After he got Reid's attention, Bigelow's aerospace company then won the $22 million contract to run the Pentagon's secret program, as first reported by the New York Times late last year. (Reid and Bigelow did not respond to requests for comment.) Despite its peculiar mandate, Bigelow Aerospace's output was typical of federal bureaucracy: It produced paper. There was a 490-page report on alleged UFO sightings, and a series of studies on experimental physics. One study written for the Defense Intelligence Agency ("Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy") urged federal research into interstellar travel and was illustrated with a childish drawing of a dinosaur greeting Albert Einstein through a hole in the space-time continuum.

[91x.com](http://www.91x.com/adam/tom-delonge-releasing-non-fiction-book-detailing-ufo-findings/) But the secret program's collection of weird military videos was what made headlines, starting with the December New York Times article. Whatever is in the videos "isn't human, it's not natural, it's under artificial control," says Eric W. Davis, the astrophysicist who wrote the study on wormholes and stargates. "We don't know where it comes from. But it's here, and has been here for some time." The good news is that now, maybe we the public will finally get some answers, and if we do, we'll owe a huge amount of gratitude to Tom DeLonge. To find out more, visit the To the Stars website.
