When we think of earthquake zones, we think of the area along the unstable and constantly shifting Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean or along one of the many major fault lines that runs through California, but after a recent discover in England, scientists are saying that London may be in the running for a pretty strong earthquake as well.

Researchers from Imperial College have discovered two faults, one running under central London and another below Canary Wharf. But fortunately there is only a one on a thousand year chance of chance of a severe tremor. The two faults are moving at a rate of 1 or 2mm a year._

[_Wikimedia Commons_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/London) _Experts say the findings have overturned the traditional view that London is geological stable. “It now looks a modestly active, very heavily faulted, complicated area,” explained Dr Richard Ghail, a specialist in civil and environmental engineering at the university. “It’s probably gone from the simplest to most complex geology in the UK.” He said the likelihood of an earthquake is “enough to be scary but not fundamentally a problem”. The tremor would be similar to standing on platform between two trains. However, there is also a slim chance of magnitude six earthquake, which could cause structural damage. The radar findings are being used to draw up seismic guidelines for new and renovated buildings in London, which will be designed to withstand magnitude 6.5 tremors._

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault) Scary, but not a problem? Doesn't sound all that reassuring, but maybe the odds are in London's favor since it hasn't had an earthquake since the 1700's. The most recent quake in England took place in 2008 when Market Rasen, located about 170 miles north of London, experienced an earthquake with a 5.2 magnitude.
