With Kilauea continuing to rumble and erupt and new development has threatened the homes of the last remaining residents in the Leilani Estates and dashing the hope that this will come to an end sometime soon. There's now a fast moving lava flow that's headed straight toward the residential area and isolated about 40 homes, prompting a dramatic helicopter rescue of homeowners who'd been trying to wait out the volcano.

Though road access was severed to the homes, at least three vehicles were seen escaping by going off-road, said Talmadge Magno, Civil Defense administrator. Another vehicle with about three passengers was stranded on the other side of the flow.

[NPS.gov](https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/lava2.htm) Magno said it became too dark to rescue them by helicopter but it was possible for them to walk to safety. He said helicopters will return as soon as it’s safe this morning and crews remained on the ground overnight monitoring the flows. It was not clear if any more residents remained. Magno said the vent appeared to have waned and the flow wasn’t immediately threatening the highway. No mandatory evacuations were being issued Friday evening, though he reiterated residents who depend on that road should prepare to leave if they haven’t already.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the flow was advancing 300 to 400 yards an hour as of 6:30 p.m. Friday. Aaron Mitchell, who lives in Lanipuna Gardens but has since evacuated, said he was driving on Pohoiki Road to check on his home when the lava crossed the road. He estimated lava was moving 10 feet per minute.
