pinterest We all understand the impact of a good marketing strategy for a business. We value our clients, and we thought some more potential clients could be shopping at Walmart, so we brought our services advert right at their doorstep. **Sorry But I Forgot to Put on My Diapers** [**http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/swamp-people/**](http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/swamp-people/) What the heck is that? Did someone just step out of their house without putting on their diapers? Or should we just assume that they had run out of stock, so they are here to shop for more? I'll leave it and concentrate on other things. [Amanda B](http://www.writeraccess.com/writer/20641/)
