American History bears records of some of the smartest and dumbest leaders in the world history. The 45th president, Donald Trump is one of a kind. The self-proclaimed billionaire has exhibited a number of times that he is either uninformed on the requirement of the law or just doesn’t give a damn. More than 4,500 lawsuits have been filed against him and his businesses.

From tax evasion to immigration laws, President Trump seems to have broken all the laws that you can think of including educational laws. Here are 16 instances of these violations.  

**1\. Misusing corporate resources**
------------------------------------

CNBC It is no news that Melanie Trump plagiarized the inauguration speech of the previous first lady, Michelle Obama. However, there is more to it. The speechwriter, McIver, worked for Trump Organization, not in his campaign team and was never paid by the campaign team for her services. This is against federal laws that prohibit the use of corporate services without proper compensation.  

2\. Deceptive business practices
--------------------------------

During his “Make America Great Again” campaign, Trump launched his book, “Crippled America.” He promised that the proceeds from the book would go to charity. There are no records of such contributions. The law categorizes such as consumer fraud, or deceptive business practice.  

3\. Charitable Solicitation laws
--------------------------------

blogspot During the campaign period, Trump said that the products that bore his names such as the Trump University, Trump board game, and Trump Vodka always went to charity.

4\. IRS self-dealing law
------------------------

This statute makes it a criminal offense to promise appointments to individuals when soliciting for their support during campaigns. In an interview on Newsmax TV, on March 14, 2016, Ben Carson hinted that Donald Trump had promised him an advisory role in his government if he (Ben Carson) endorsed him. Unfortunately, it seems Trump never kept his promise.

-------------------------------

shawetcanada Before receiving a global criticism for the immigration laws he had in mind, Trump had already broken a few of the existing ones. In 2014, Jamaican fashion model, Alexia Palmer accused Trump Model Management of promising to pay her $75,000 annually while staying in the US. She had only received $3,880.75 at the end of three years.  

11\. Anti-discrimination laws

yimg In 1991 nine employees at the Trump Plaza sued the billionaire’s casino for violating anti-discrimination laws at the request of a famous gambler Robert Libutti. Libutti was infamous for his open hatred towards women, blacks, and other minorities. Instead of upholding the law by keeping him out of the premises, Trump obliged to his request of keeping this class of people from Libutti’s tables.  

12\. Sexually harassing women
-----------------------------

The fact that he dismissed the public uproar terming the revelation as a locker room talk does not make it legally acceptable.  

13\. Sales tax laws
-------------------

NBC As a president, Trump’s first major brush with the law was his request to James Coney, the former FBI director, asking him to drop investigations against Michael Flynn. General Flynn had been the centre of a grand jury investigation in which the FBI was an active participant. Such action was a violation of section 1512 of the 18 US Code.
