[C/Net](https://www.cnet.com/news/artificial-womb-could-grow-mammoth-elephant-hybrid-harvard-researchers/) reports now that scientists have successfully duplicated 44 mammoth genes, they are now hoping to grow a mammoth-hybrid in an artificial womb. The large hairy elephant walked the earth as early as 2.5 million years ago before going extinct around 3rd millennium B.C. A team of researchers at Harvard University, headed up by well-known geneticist Professor George Church, participated in the Fourth International Vatican Conference in Vatican City on April 27. While there, Church announced the idea of a woolly mammoth-hybrid but cautioned that his team was focused on the first step.

"My goal is not to bring back the mammoth, it's to bring back mammoth genes and show that they work and that we have already done it," he said. The idea is to use an artificial uterus, termed a "vascularised decidua", that will have a functioning uterine wall with its own vascular structure. The Harvard team proposes starting small, using mouse stem cells to recreate a viable birth chamber.

Advancements in genetics will allow biologists to create a revived mammoth that will have a wider diet and may not sport its iconic large, curving ivory tusks so as to deny poachers another prize to hunt down.
