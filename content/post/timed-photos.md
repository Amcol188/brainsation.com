You might be the best photographer there is out there but sometimes, you don’t have to be the best to take a perfect photo. You just need to be at the right place in the right moment. It will not matter if you take it with a phone or a very good camera; you just need to be passionate about what you do. Most of the time, you won’t even notice you took an awesome photo till you sit down to look at them.

## Good Boy Sees Good Buns

[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LizodLrg7ho) I'm not really sure you can interpret this photo any other way.  That dog is absolutely GIDDY with excitement over these two beach babes standing in front of him.

## Put Some Clothes On?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3149.jpg)

[funfeel](http://www.funfeel.net/18-smeshnih-snimkov/) I legitimately looked at this picture for 3 minutes thinking that girl is naked.  It just looks way too much like she is.  The timing and angle on this photo is impeccable!

## Hey, Put Some Underwear On!

## ![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3.jpg)

[buzzclown](http://www.buzzclown.com/amazingly-dirty-photos-you-have-to-see/7/?utm_term) For a minute the crowd really thought they got more than they paid for.  Maybe you should get some different colored compression shorts?

## When You See It!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Pic-13-Copy.jpg) Get your 

mind out of the gutter!

## They Learn Young

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kid-Boobs.jpg)

This kid is going to love college...

## When You See It! Part 2

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/unintentionally-sexual-photos-8-Copy-Copy.jpg)

Close them legs girl! Oh wait...carry on.

## Say Cheese!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/perfectly-timed-photos-2.jpg)

"OMG, this one is going to be so cute on instagram!"  Not only is their picture ruined (or made more awesome?) but they are in for a quick surprise is half a second.  They about to be all wet.

## DUCK!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/images-4.jpg) 

This girl is about to feel some serious pain.  She is enjoying a nice selfie at the ballpark one minute, and the next she has a serious concussion.  That ball was absolutely smashed to the top of the Green Monster!

## The Wave Monster Gets Another Victim

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/935348263274d31fc7c1ef38f99c9b2d.jpg) 

If you have ever been splashing around in the ocean, you know when a big wave comes, all of your clothing is at risk of disappearing.  Good save by her hand.

## Her Shadow Is Dirty

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/379.jpg) 

That is one sick shadow!

## Perfect!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/b7b7b0357458ec99fdf8bd966b2a9bbe.jpg) 

Did they plan this outfit together? Because if they did that is awesome.  And if they didn't, then, LOL.

## This baby must be proud of that booty!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-36.jpg)

The photo must have been taken with intentions? The face is too tiny compared to the body. Or is it that the body grew and forgot the head?  Whatever it is, that baby has some fine legs.  I wonder what it's going to look like when it gets older?

## Snowboarder walks on the moon

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/204711082.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed2/204711082.jpg) First of all, imagine walking on the moon! It is amazing right? But being able to capture that moment is even more amazing given that the moon seems quite small.

## Former president Obama captured holding the sun.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/863294872.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed3/863294872.jpg)

Surprised? Well, he is not literally holding the sun but imagine what a good story that is. The sun is right in the palm of his hands till the, president Donald Trump blew it up.

## Who hasn’t experienced this once in a while?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1949884.jpg)

[ScoopWhoop](https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/perfectly_timed3/1949884.jpg)

This is funny right? But who hasn’t been in this position especially on a Monday morning after a long weekend? To make the matters worse, you are called in a for a meeting even before you grab some coffee.

## Now, this is what we call a red carpet fall

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/jasonderulofalling-fb-420x453.jpg)

[PressCDN](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jasonderulofalling-fb-420x453-1.jpg)

Apologies to Jason Darulo but seriously, this is so hilarious having to come all the way only to fall at the red carpet right?

## What are you doing?

![](https://d1orvytp1tjw37.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/01/subwayshade-fb-545x453.jpg)

[PressCDN](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/subwayshade-fb-545x453-1.jpg)

Ever looked at someone and wondered what they are doing? Well, this photographer was able to capture the best side eye ever. Take a look and comment.

## When its dad’s time to babysit.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-89.jpg)

Diapers got to be changed right? Also, you got to be armed appropriately for the task ahead. Honestly, kudos to our dear mums.

## Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-13.jpg)

[BoredPanda](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-13.jpg)

The above photo could not be timed any better. It is just perfect. It was taken in the right angle and at the right time, with the water amazingly clinging to the dress as if cut from the same cloth.

## Where is the head?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/280718454.jpg)

It is hard to imagine how much training this guy had to undergo to get to this position. You could easily assume he is a headless gymnast.

## Is the moon being moved?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/482038603.jpg)

Is the crane being used to move the moon towards the right? Wow! What a good timing to take the photo.

## Are those horns above a church?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/295606563.jpg)

The horns are just above the church. Let’s equate the church to be good and the horns to be evil. Is evil going above the good or are the two meeting at one place?

## Did this movie actually pose to give room for the cat?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/365149114.jpg)

This lady seems to be asking the cat “what do you want now?” and the cat seems to be so busy enjoying the show to notice.

## Hmm…hard to decide given I want them all

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-26.jpg)

Why would I have to choose when I can eat all of them? Hmm… the look when you can hear nothing but hunger pangs.

## Who said alcohol should be taken in small amounts?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-105.jpg)

This man looks like he is deep in his own world. It seems like it is so sweet to even open his eyes. Alcohol can make you forget even your own self.

## What is the size of your brain?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-109.jpg)

You don’t need to be so big to be intelligent. You just have to be wise as well as have brains to get to where you need to be. This kid knows how to use his brains.

## Who is good at training?

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-100.jpg)

If you are a girl child, you are lucky. Your mother is right there to teach you and help you grow but if you are a boy, you better catch up and learn from your father. Hmm…

## I said I need trimming only

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-16.jpg)

Ever found yourself in this position? Regretting every decision you have made to a point you wish you were not born? Well, this girl probably felt the same way.

## This baby must be proud of that booty!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-36.jpg)

The photo must have been taken with intentions? The face is too tiny compared to the body. Or is it that the body grew and forgot the head?

## The world is too complicated to comprehend

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/funny-perfectly-timed-pictures-35.jpg)

She actually needs aerials to think better. The photographer must have been timing to capture this photo. She is just right before the street lights yet she seems to have aerials on top of her head right?

## She must be scared of her own selfie.

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-55.jpg)

That moment you take a selfie and once you look at it, you get scared of what you see only to realize that is you.

## I must have my Friday night no matter what!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image-1011.jpg)

The man seems to be having the time of his life. Clothes or no clothes, the party must go on. Life is too short to worry about small things like having clothes or wearing women’s shoes.

## When The Bubble Bursts

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/690597304-1516662112472.jpg) 

[Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/collection/Y1khRE) This was either the luckiest photograph in history or it was the product of days of tireless work until they got the timing just right. The reflection of the world around and the photographer in the bubble makes it all the more poignant. This is simply an astonishing and wonderful image.

## Bring Back My Ice Cream!

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ladung4-1516662231937.jpg) 

[Vulieu](http://vulieu.net/board/index.php?action=vthread&forum=13&topic=5108) We really love the look of surprise on the mailman's face. He looks like nothing in his life could have prepared him for this moment, and who can blame him? Seagulls are a real problem in major cities and beach destinations now and it's because of this type of behavior - they keep stealing from visitors. This lucky gull's taking a Cornetto home to share with his children.

## Wait, I'm Just Going To Lie Down In Mid-Air

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/b3e716da7104000079ce9df3d12c1a66-perfectly-timed-photos-perfect-timing-1516662290907.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ie/kuspus/perfectly-timed-photos/) This appears to be the work of perfect happenstance; the photographer's not positioned to get the framing exactly right and the resolution's not great either, but it works. We can't imagine what's going through the minds of the five people laying on the mat, waiting for their friend to fall.

## It's Just A Little Indigestion

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20-1516662374385.jpg) 

[Sabah](https://www.sabah.com.tr/galeri/dunya/fotografci-tam-o-anda-dugmeye-basti/20) These photos are becoming more popular because it's not that hard to stage them when you think about it. However, this appears to have been the first modern-era attempt at a man coughing up a plane on film. It's a classic take on things and it does require perfect timing, so it's on our list.

## Popping Your Cherry On Film

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/16-20-1516662441539.jpg) 

[Telegrafi](https://telegrafi.com/mos-humbni-keto-imazhe-te-shkrepura-ne-momentin-e-duhur-foto/) Get your mind out of the gutter! This is a simply superb shot of a bird at feeding time. Nature photography is usually hard work. It requires an awful lot of time to capture an image like this - you never see the 3,000 shots where the timing wasn't so perfect.

## Bye Bye Robin Redbreast

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/21032681_1639967219347165_4278337966772577475_n-1516662539324.jpg) 

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lmmm.tw/photos/a.1423234594353763.1073741826.546265028717395/1639967219347165/?type=3&theater) This robin is minding its own business and sadly, it's going to be the last thing it ever does in this world. Yes, that's a snake going in for the kill behind it and it seems highly unlikely that the robin is destined for anything other than the afterlife now.

## And Then This Man Fell Out Of My...

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/foto-scattate-al-momento-giusto-4-1516662700911.jpg) 

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFYhUeA4nNY) This one feels like perfect serendipity. There's a friend or possibly boyfriend taking the "impressed you do cartwheels" photo for Facebook and the guy in the background is just getting on with cleaning his boat. The two then combine for an image which is somewhat startling, to say the least.

## This Is Going To Hurt You More Than It Hurts Me

![](https://simplyaddicted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/521adb114fa614cf44bc34b2db214f55-1516662830599.jpg) 

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/573364596283354571/) If you ever wondered what it looks like when a bee decides that it has had enough of someone and initiates its "sting the guy" protocol - this is it. We hope that this was a lucky shot and not the work of rehearsal after rehearsal. It's been a long time (knock on wood) since we've been stung, but we remember that it hurts like heck!

## The Hand Of God

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2014-125-1516662913986.jpg) 

[Tout Sure Google Earth](https://www.tout-sur-google-earth.com/t19578-les-photos-qu-on-aurait-voulu-prendre) Sure, there's an element of patient photographic staging in this delightful image of Christ on the cross appearing to capture an airplane in mid-flight. That doesn't detract from the need to get the timing exactly right. We don't know how many flights a day go through that area of the sky, the photographer might have waited weeks to capture this.

## It's A Pelican, Not A Two-can

![](http://americancolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/z_odpowiedniej_perspektywy_nr10_6-1516662989998.jpg) 

[Fundir](https://fundir.org/gallery,z_odpowiedniej_perspektywy_nr10,9829) Toucan, two-can, geddit? We're sorry. We can't resist a terrible pun and we're a sucker for shots like this one, too. This isn't pelican siamese twins that you're seeing but rather two birds in flight, so close together, that they appear to be a single bird. It's the image of a photographer's lifetime.
