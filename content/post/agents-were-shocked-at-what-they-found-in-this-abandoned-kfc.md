### AN ORDINARY DAY PROVES TO BE ANYTHING BUT…

When San Luis Police Officer Duane Williams woke up on that September morning, nothing seemed eventful or unusual.

“I drank my coffee like I do everyday and read the paper,” said Williams, a 13-year veteran of the force. “I had breakfast with my wife and two girls before they left for school. We had eggs and some toast, if I remember correctly.”

Officer Williams knows that ordinary can go to extraordinary pretty quickly in the course of routine police work.

But that particular Tuesday would be one for the record books.

“I’ve lost friends and colleagues in the service of this community,” he said. “This isn’t always an easy job, but we take an oath to serve the public trust. My job is to protect the innocent and uphold the law to the best of my ability.”

Williams is a member of an elite squad of San Luis officers that work closely with state and federal agencies to curtail drug and human trafficking from Mexico.

The result of a federal grant in 2014, the San Luis Vice Squad has seized over three tons of marijuana and made almost eight hundred arrests since they commenced their service.

“We’re pretty proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish,” said Officer Williams.

The squad and Officer Williams received national media attention last year when his team uncovered quite a surprise in an abandoned Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“We knew that something was up with that location,” said Williams. “All of the circumstances surrounding the property just didn’t add up.”

The agents knew they had hit pay dirt when they found the tiny opening concealing a much larger hole…

### THE HOLE IN THE TILE WAS ONLY EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER

“It was barely large enough to fit a 15-piece family bucket of chicken,” said Officer Duane Williams.

It could have easily been overlooked as just another deteriorating aspect of an dilapidated fast food restaurant, had local police not known better.

After all, this wasn’t just any vacant KFC but one in San Luis, Arizona, situated some 200 yards north of the border the United States shares with Mexico.

“From the old drive-through lane, you can see the fence separating San Luis from Mexico in your rear-view mirror,” said Williams.

Back on August 13th, local police had arrested the building’s owner, Ivan Lopez, during a routine traffic stop.

And according to the arresting officer, it was “pretty memorable.”

“It’s not everyday you catch an honest to God kingpin,” said Officer Sandra Jackson.

### OFFICER JACKSON SNARES A REAL DEAL KINGPIN

When San Luis Police Officer Sandra Jackson pulled over Ivan Lopez, 41, she knew to exercise caution.

From the registration tags on his license plate, she was able to run his arrest record on her dashboard computer.

“All this information is available to anyone with a internet connection, but he has priors for domestic assault, possession, and child support violations,” said Jackson. “I approached his vehicle with my service revolver drawn.”

{{< post_ad >}}

After a search of Lopez’s person, the seasoned officer found a small amount of white powder she believed to be cocaine.

However, once she opened the trunk, Jackson discovered over a million dollars worth of illegal drugs.

But that was just the beginning of a long and twisted story of an unbelievable feat of underground construction…

### LOPEZ LEADS SAN LUIS POLICE TO AN ABANDONED KFC

Public records reveal that Lopez had bought the former KFC in April, paying some $390,000 in cash for the rundown restaurant.

“The vice squad had been watching Lopez since the Spring,” said Officer Duane Williams. “A tip alerted us to the cash purchase of the property, which obviously, was pretty suspicious. We had been waiting to arrest the suspect on related charges, but the traffic stop brought things to a head a little sooner than we expected.”

{{< post_ad >}}

Soon after Lopez’s arrest, Immigration and Customs Enforcement obtained a search warrant and surrounded the building.

“It was really exciting,” remembered Williams. “We had over twenty officers suited up that day.”

Once inside, both local and federal authorities were shocked at what they found.

“This was no fried chicken joint any more,” said Williams. “This was the big time.”

### THE HOLE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING

The agents’ suspicions of organized, criminal activity were confirmed with the discovery of an eight-inch opening along a wall in the restaurant’s rear kitchen area.

“You could have easily missed it, if you didn’t know what you were looking for,” said Officer Williams. “The whole building was in disarray. There were lots of holes.”

{{< post_ad >}}

Agents chipped away at it’s sides and, as the concrete gave way, the hole became larger and larger.

One person shimmied down into the space and turned on a flashlight, scanning the surroundings.

Hundreds of wooden two-by-four boards lined the walls…

### THE SECRET TUNNEL WAS AN UNDERGROUND DRUG HIGHWAY

The discovery prompted the inevitable comparisons to _Breaking Bad_and _Los Pollos Hermanos_.

Countless news stories relayed the tunnel’s dimensions: three feet wide, five feet tall, and about 600 feet long.

The local news constantly repeated the sensational figure that “more than $1 million worth of cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin” had been found the day before on Lopez.

{{< post_ad >}}

“We’re the largest border city in Arizona with almost 38,000 people and growing very rapidly,” said Richard Jessup, San Luis Police Chief.

But the tunnel affirmed another unspoken rule on America’s southwest border.

“What can’t go up, must go down,” said Jessup. “Or rather, what can’t go over the wall can and will go under it.”

This wasn’t the first tunnel, and it certainly wasn’t the most sophisticated one to be discovered along the border…

### BUT THIS WASN’T THE FIRST TUNNEL IN SAN LUIS

The KFC tunnel was simply the latest passaged to be uncovered in an ongoing game of drug-trafficking whack-a-mole that has literally gone underground.

“Unusual? Yes. But surprising? No,” said Police Chief Richard Jessup.

Another tunnel had been found in the city in 2012, also close to the former KFC.

{{< post_ad >}}

Jessup was quick to note that there is already a border wall that spans far beyond San Luis city limits, comprised of not one, but two twenty-foot-tall fences.

“It’s very difficult in our area to get over that wall. You either are going to take a drone and fly it over or you are going to try to tunnel underneath it,” Jessup said.

But just how successful are the drug traffickers’ efforts?

You might be surprised…

### THE DRUG CARTELS ARE GETTING MORE SOPHISTICATED

There have been 203 tunnels discovered in the US Border Patrol’s history.

“This was the fifth tunnel to be discovered in that region since 2007,” said Border Patrol spokesman Jose Garibay III.

Most are rudimentary, hand-dug tunnels that are essentially “dangerous, unfinished passages.”

{{< post_ad >}}

In rare instances, however, agents will come upon a “sophisticated tunnel,” with power lines, ventilation systems, and concrete flooring.

“Generally, along the Southwest border, every couple of months, we’re encountering a tunnel,” said ICE Special Agent Scott Brown. “Tunnels are something we’re constantly on the lookout for.”

Brown believes the farthest a tunnel has made it across the US border is about 2,000 feet.

{{< post_ad >}}

Tunnels can be difficult to detect without sophisticated equipment or tips from concerned citizens.

However, there are a couple of dead giveaways.

And according to Brown, one is a surprising no-brainer…

### THE AUTHORITIES KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR

“One thing is a big pile of dirt,” Brown said. “Again, this is a 5-foot-by-3-foot-wide hole that’s about 590-feet-long. A rough estimate is about 200 tons of dirt they had to get out of there and move surreptitiously.”

And it’s actually fairly common for an unwitting resident on either side of the border to report suspicious noises to law enforcement.

{{< post_ad >}}

“We’ve had instances where people have come in and said, ‘Hey, I’m sitting in my house at night, and I hear this constant scratching, and I can’t figure out what it is,’” Brown said. “Well, again, you tell that to an HSI or Border Patrol agent, they’re going to guess somebody’s digging underneath your house or in close proximity to your house.”

But it’s not just drugs that are coming through the clandestine underground shafts.

Sadly, there’s a whole lot more going on…

### UNFORTUNATELY, IT’S NOT JUST DRUGS COMING THROUGH…

Although this particular tunnel appears to have been limited to the drug trade, owing to the tiny opening on the US side, that’s not always the case.

“All too often, we see human beings smuggled through these tunnels,” said Brown.

On the Mexico side, the tunnel’s entrance was hidden beneath a trapdoor under a bed in a residential home.

{{< post_ad >}}

More alarming than the existence of the tunnel was what passed through it.

“Generally, with tunnels what we’ve seen is marijuana,” added Brown. “This was a purely hard narcotics tunnel. Everything that we seized was hard narcotics. So I think that’s what makes this tunnel a little unique and frankly a little more scary than some of the other ones we’ve seen.”

The uncovering of these tunnels comes on the heels of a national debate about immigration, both legal and illegal.

And then there’s the opioid crisis…

### TRUMP’S SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN ISSUE WAS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

Illegal immigration to the United States was a signature issue of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and his proposed reforms and remarks about this issue continue to generate much publicity.

A hallmark promise of his campaign was to build a “massive wall” on the United States-Mexico border. Trump has also expressed support for a variety of “limits on legal immigration and guest-worker visas,” including a “pause” on granting green cards.

{{< post_ad >}}

“There can be no doubt that illegal immigrants are coming through the tunnels like the one we recently discovered in San Luis,” said Office Duane Williams. “But it’s been our experience that, mostly, these underground highways convey drugs and not people.”

President Trump has repeatedly characterized such immigrants as criminals, although multiple studies have found they have lower crime and incarceration rates than native-born Americans.

{{< post_ad >}}

“And while I can’t really comment on specific illegal immigration statistics, I can comment on another contentious issue,” said Williams. “That’s the opioid epidemic. I do know those numbers.”

Unfortunately, with the high volume of illegal pharmaceuticals coming through the border, San Luis has seen it’s fair share of overdose deaths…

### THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AFFECTS EVERYONE

Since the late 1990s, opioid use has skyrocketed across America.

In 2014, 18,893 Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses. That’s more deaths than any previous year, and more than quadruple the deaths in 1999.

“Almost no other major cause of death in America has increased so rapidly,” said Officer Williams.

{{< post_ad >}}

Those who lose their lives from opioid overdoses are not the only ones affected. The opioid epidemic hollows out families and communities.

It presents a grim challenge to health care providers, to law enforcement, and to society as a whole.

“These are our brothers and our sisters,” said Williams. “The man sitting underneath a bridge with a needle in his arm is somebody’s father or son. This absolutely has to stop.”
