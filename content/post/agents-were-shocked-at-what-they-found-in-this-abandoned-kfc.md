## AN ORDINARY DAY PROVES TO BE ANYTHING BUT…

When San Luis Police Officer Duane Williams woke up on that September morning, nothing seemed eventful or unusual.

“I drank my coffee like I do everyday and read the paper,” said Williams, a 13-year veteran of the force. “I had breakfast with my wife and two girls before they left for school. We had eggs and some toast, if I remember correctly.”

Officer Williams knows that ordinary can go to extraordinary pretty quickly in the course of routine police work.

But that particular Tuesday would be one for the record books.

The result of a federal grant in 2014, the San Luis Vice Squad has seized over three tons of marijuana and made almost eight hundred arrests since they commenced their service.

“We’re pretty proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish,” said Officer Williams.

The squad and Officer Williams received national media attention last year when his team uncovered quite a surprise in an abandoned Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“We knew that something was up with that location,” said Williams. “All of the circumstances surrounding the property just didn’t add up.”

The agents knew they had hit pay dirt when they found the tiny opening concealing a much larger hole…
