Law enforcement officials were called to a spa in Washington, D.C. on May 6. Once they arrived on scene they discovered the body of 28-year-old Ascendance Biomedical founder Aaron Traywick in a flotation therapy tank, reports [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/biohacker-herpes-drug-untested-aaron-traywick-washington-spa-biochemist-a8334016.html). Traywick gained recent notoriety when he injected himself with an untested herpes drug while in front of an audience. Traywick and his company advocated for biohacking, a broad term applied to methods of treating disease or overall health without the aid of pharmaceutical products.

[The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/science/2018/05/02/controversial-ceo-and-biohacker-aaron-traywick-found-dead-at-28/) Initial comments by investigators claim that there is no appearance of foul play and an autopsy is scheduled but toxicology results tend to take weeks to finalize. Traywick also turned heads recently when he claimed that his company had created a cure for HIV and AIDS, developments that have been left unproven. The American government had continually pushed back against Traywick and other biohackers, saying that they lone wolf procedures were dangerous and violating the law.

Laws, biohackers would say, designed to give Big Pharma a monopoly on drugs and treatments.

[Tech Times](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/226638/20180501/aaron-traywick-biohacker-who-famously-injected-himself-with-diy-herpes-treatment-found-dead-at-28.htm) A business associate Tristan Roberts called Traywick a “passionate visionary” in a statement sent to Vice News. “While many in the biohacking scene disagreed with his methods, none of them doubted his intentions. “He sought nothing short of a revolution in biomedicine; the democratization of science and the opening of the flood gates for global healing.” But now, some are wondering what will become of the bio-hacking movement, a grass roots campaign with dubious methods but the noble goal of making medicine available and affordable for all people. From [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/aaron-traywick-death-ascendance-biomedical/559745/): _For the time being, not much has changed. The biohackers who worked with Traywick are still developing highly experimental products, including the one to cure HIV—just not under the auspices of Ascendance \[Traywick's company\]. A new shadowy figure has even stepped in to fund such projects in Traywick’s absence, a transhumanist offering some of Traywick’s old collaborators money to fund his work. And one of Traywick’s sometime partners in Europe is even attempting to take over the work of Ascendance and continue its mission. Ascendance was a “decentralized” company, with no clear hierarchy other than Traywick at the top, so in the aftermath, no one is quite sure what will happen. What is clear, is that in death, Traywick’s impact may loom even larger than it did in life._
