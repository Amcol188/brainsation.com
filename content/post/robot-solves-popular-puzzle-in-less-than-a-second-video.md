Remember the Rubik’s Cube? Those old enough to can probably appreciate this author’s level of frustration with the 3D puzzle. My frustration got to the point that I even peeled off (poorly) the stickers on the segments so I could pretend I successfully finished it.

Not my proudest moment. I was certainly nowhere close to current Guinness World Records holder Patrick Ponce from the USA, who completed a 3x3x3 cube in just 4.69 seconds in September of last year. [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5763492/rubiks-cube-world-record-fastest-time-robot/) reports that Ponce is also nowhere near to being close to the skills of a robot crafted by American researchers Ben Katz and Jared Di Carlo. They designed a robot with six arms, two cameras and used a secret algorithm that had their synthetic buddy completing the puzzle in 0.38 seconds.

According to the Sun the “Rubik's Cube was first created back in 1974 and is one of the most popular and well-known 3D puzzle games in the world.”

Katz and Di Carlo’s robot have beaten out the old record holder dubbed Sub1 Reloaded, designed by German engineer Albert Beer, which completed the puzzle in 0.637 seconds. As robotics and AI continue to advance, look for additional human achievements to go by the wayside.
