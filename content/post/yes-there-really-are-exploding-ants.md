As acts of terror and acts of war, humans have been willing to destroy themselves if it meant killing the enemy. From kamikaze pilots to suicide bombers, this is nothing new. What's surprising, though, is that there's a counter part to this in the animal kingdom. [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a19874159/scientists-discover-new-species-of-exploding-ant/) has written an article that tells of a certain species of ant that acts, in essence, like a suicide bomber.

Poplular Mechanics\[/caption\] **Self-Sacrifice** It has been known for decades now that the worker segment of the _Colobopsis_ species of ant exploded as part of their defensive tools against predators. According to Popular Mechanics, these ants have the ability to "choose to rupture their abdominal wall, spraying their stomach fluids on everything around them." The stomach fluids are highly toxic and can severely deter or incapacitate a predator.

Mississippi Entomological Museum\[/caption\] **A New Find** A group of researchers recently decided to track down and number the different sub-species of the _Colobopsis_ and traveled to Malaysia and Indonesia in the their quest. During the hunt, they numbered 15 types of previously-known _Colobopsis_ and uncovered an undiscovered one as well. The new species, classified as _Colobopsis explodens_, is said to be a prime example of that species.

**Allahu Ant-bar** While 'worker insects' are noted for their 'expendability', much like entry level salesmen at insurance companies, they are a valued and integral part of the preservation of the species. That being said, the interest of scientists in the jihadist-like suicide attack bugs comes at an convenient time for those looking to lend any defense to the actions of the _Colobopsis'_ human equivalents.
