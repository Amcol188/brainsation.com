Rafferty Law definitely has a lot to thank his father for when it comes to his looks, which the 20-year-old has used to kick-start a career as a singer and model.

With 33,000 Instagram followers, Raff (as he is often called) is a well-known face on runways, a producer of his own music, and one of the founders of the creative collective Something to Hate On.

“He’s been musical since he was a kid,” said father Jude. “He would drag all the pots and pans out from the kitchen cabinets and bang on those all day long.”
