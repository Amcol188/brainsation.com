When you think of the wealthy these days, you think of billionaires like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, and Jeff Bezos. While all of these are busy stirring up their fortunes on terra firma, famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson believe that space will produce the first trillionaire.

From the [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/697701/space-mining-first-trillionaire-asteroid-mark-zuckerberg-bill-gates-jeff-bezos): _“The first trillionaire there will ever be is the person who exploits the natural resources on asteroids._ “There’s this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless resources.

look at wars fought over access to resources. That could be a thing of the past, once space becomes our backyard.” The first trillionaire would have more money than Gates, Bezos, and Zuckerberg combined! This lucrative opportunity has also shown up on Goldman-Sachs' radar.

The investment bank said in a recent statement: “While the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is _high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower._ “Prospecting probes can likely be built for tens of millions of dollars each and Caltech has suggested an asteroid-grabbing spacecraft could cost $2.6 billion.” At the moment, the race to bring back these flying metals is between private companies.

However, this looks set to change after Luxembourg established the Space Resources Initiative. The country’s government is planning to dole out millions in funding to companies looking to exploit space’s natural resources. Our goal is to put into place an overall framework for the exploration and commercial use of resources from ‘celestial bodies’ such as asteroids, or from the moon,” commented Etienne Schneider, Luxembourg’s deputy prime minister and minister of the economy.
