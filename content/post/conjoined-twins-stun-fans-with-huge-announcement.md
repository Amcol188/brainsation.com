Conjoined Twins Stun Fans With Huge Announcement: 'We've Prayed About It...'

<h3><a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Abby-and-Brittany-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-23233"><img class="size-full wp-image-23233 aligncenter" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Abby-and-Brittany-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="337" /></a></h3>
<h3>"Of course we've thought about this long and hard," said Abby Hensel. "We've prayed about it and we're confident that this is the right decision for us." Her sister Brittany added, "You only live once and we just feel like it's time."</h3>
Sisters Abby and Brittany Hensel are conjoined twins that have been defying expectations since the day they made their debut into this world. When they were born, they made international headlines for being one of the very few conjoined twins to survive the pregnancy and delivery processes.

In the medical literature, Abby and Brittany are known as <em>dicephalic parapagus</em> twins. In layman's terms, this means that the girls each have a head, but their bodies are "unified."

Out of the already minuscule number of conjoined twins in the world, only eleven percent are <em>dicephalic parapagus</em> twins like the Hensels.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b-21-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22097"><img class="size-full wp-image-22097 aligncenter" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b-21-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>

The girls have two stomachs, two hearts, and four lungs. Because their lower trunk is shared, they only have one reproductive system.


Conjoined Twins: TLC

Abby and Brittany have control of one arm and one leg each. They've had to overcome significant challenges in order to walk, swim, and even brush their hair.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/c-20-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22099"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22099" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/c-20-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="http://www.ntd.tv/inspiring/life/conjoined-twins-abigail-brittany-hensel-offer-share-glimpse-world.html">Image Credit</a></em></h5>

The girls first drew the attention of mainstream media in 1996 when they appeared on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>. After that appearance, they lived a quiet life with their family in Minnesota. They kept out of the spotlight, busying themselves with friends, their hobbies, and schoolwork.

That's when everything began to change for the girls...

<h3>When the Hensel twins turned 16, they agreed to appear in a documentary for TLC. The broadcaster eventually gave them their own show, called <em>Abby and Brittany</em>, which premiered on Aug. 28, 2012.</h3>
<p class="image-wrap fff-pic">The series followed them on many of their milestones. For example, on their 16th birthday, Abigail and Brittany passed their driving test with a mind-boggling feat of teamwork.</p>
"Yeah, learning to drive was crazy. Abby gets road rage," said Brittany, laughing at her sister.

"That's not true," Abby retorted.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/a-3-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23097"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23097" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/a-3-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/ksKCs2">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
Their mother, Patty, conceded that driving could have been a problem for the girls.

“I don’t know what would happen if they got pulled over for speeding," she said. "Would they each get a ticket or just Abby because it’s her foot on the accelerator?”

That's a fair question!

Although the twins have been able to surmount so many challenges in their young lives, nothing had prepared them for what came next...

Conjoined Twins: Bethel University

<h3>In 2008, Abby and Brittany began college at Bethel University, majoring in education. At first, the girls wanted to specialize in different fields, but upon learning about the additional coursework, they decided against it.</h3>
"What's funny, is that when we were little, I wanted to be a pilot," said Abby. "And Brittany wanted to be a dentist. That didn't last long."

Their time at the University proved to be both rewarding and challenging as it is for most young people.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/g-5-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22100"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22100" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/g-5-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://diply.com/abby-brittany-conjoined-twins-facts?config=20">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
"Of course, at first people would stare because they weren't familiar with us yet," said Brittany with a smile. "But pretty much everyone adapted really quick. We always got invited to parties and social things. Abby is really more of a home body than me, but that's okay, we compromised."

But there's one thing that they weren't prepared to compromise on...


Conjoined Twins: Differences

<h3>"We definitely have different styles," says Abby. "Brittany's a lot more into neutrals and pearls, stuff like that. But I would rather have it be more fun and bright and colorful!"</h3>
While Abby is seen as the "outspoken" sister and will always win the argument about what they are going to wear, Brittany says her twin also has a softer side.

"She's really sensitive," said Brittany. "People don't usually realize that."

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gg-2-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22101"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22101" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gg-2-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://diply.com/abby-brittany-conjoined-twins-facts?config=20">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
There are other differences too. Brittany is scared of heights, whereas Abby is not. Abby is interested in math and science, while Brittany prefers the arts.

But that's not all that's different between the girls...


<h3>The Hensel twins also respond differently to coffee. After a few cups Brittany's heart rate increases, but Abby is not affected. They also have different body temperatures!</h3>
"I can be a totally different temperature than Brittany," said Abby. "A lot of times our hands are different temperatures and I get super hot way faster."

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j-2-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23098"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23098" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j-2-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/8eZoyo">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
And despite the fact that the twins share an immune system, Brittany tends to get sick more often than Abby.

"It's because she's sweeter and the germs are just more attracted to her," said Abby, laughing at her sister. "She's just unlucky she's so nice!"

But there's one thing the girls definitely agree on these days...

Conjoined Twins: Team Work

<h3>"We can't imagine our lives separately," said Brittany. "God made us just the way we are. We came into this world together, as a team, and we are just happy to have each other and our wonderful lives."</h3>
When the twins were first born, their parents had to decide if they wanted doctors to attempt surgical separation. But because of the well-founded fear that at least one of them wouldn’t survive, they decided against it.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-3-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22102"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22102" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/w-3-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://diply.com/abby-brittany-conjoined-twins-facts?config=20">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
As the girls have aged, they have had to undergo several other surgeries, including one to stop the growth of Abby’s spine after Brittany stopped growing.

"We've both been through a lot health-wise," said Abby, laughing. "What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Or at least more feisty."

And the girls have had a lot of experience working together, solving problems, and making due with "what God gave [them]."

Some of the most intimate, private experiences a person can have must be coordinated by the girls...


Conjoined Twins: Shared Experiences

<h3>For obvious reasons, Abby and Brittany Hensel have had to live as a team. Each girl controls one half of their body, so even the simple act of walking has to be coordinated.</h3>
In fact, this is harder than it sounds because Brittany is a few inches shorter than Abby, requiring her to basically tip-toe.

That's not all the girls have to deal with as a team. Using the restroom, bathing, and personal hygiene issues have to be jointly dealt with.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mn-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23102"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23102" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mn-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/FwmpPW">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
"It's a chore, sometimes," Brittany said while Abby shook her head, agreeing.

Conjoined twins are exceedingly rare - it is thought one in every 200,000 births - and around 40-60% of these births are delivered stillborn. Female siblings tend to have a better survival rate than male siblings, though.

But the girls recently made a huge announcement that stunned their fans...

Conjoined Twins: New Job

<h3>The twins recently announced that they had found work as part-time elementary school teachers.</h3>
<span class="s1">“We are fourth- and fifth-grade math specialists, so we’ll have two classes of math," said Abby.</span>

<span class="s1">"It’s part time, which is nice, so we’ll be kind of transitioning into the teaching world,” Brittany added.</span>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ww-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22103"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22103" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ww-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/dgFm2J">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Patty said that she thinks her daughters made an excellent decision by working with children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“They’ve just always had a knack with kids, and kids have always been kind of drawn to them. Maybe it started by curiosity, but then once their simple questions are answered, they still are just drawn to Ab and Brit,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1">But what's their major concern about their new job?</p>


<h3>As they embark on their working life together, the twins aim to take things day by day and keep their expectations to a minimum.</h3>
With their position as teachers, they have become role models for children academically, but also in their attitude to life.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23099"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23099" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/y-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/8QMx46">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
"I don't think there's anything that they won't try or something that they couldn't be able to do if they really wanted to," says Paul Good, principal of the school where Abby and Brittany work.

But not everyone was quite so thrilled about the Hensel twins taking a teaching gig...

Conjoined Twins: Trouble At The Work

<h3>"People are not always so nice," said Abby. "Human beings, by their very nature, are curious. So it's understandable when people stare or ask to have their picture taken with us. That's fine for the most part."</h3>
Brittany was quick to add, "But sometimes they say hurtful things, and if you let it, it can get you down."

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lj-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23100"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23100" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lj-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/KiJgS7">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
After the Hensel twins accepted their part-time position teaching elementary school, some parents made disparaging comments on the school's Facebook page.

"How are you going to let these freaks teach our children," one woman posted. "Why couldn't the district just have hired a regular teacher and been done with it?"

But despite the controversy, the girls are thankful that they have one special friend to look out for them...


<h3>As a close friend of the twins, Erin Junkans says you always need to be alert because you never quite know how people are going to react or what they are going to say.</h3>
"I want to make sure that they're safe and that they're not completely exposed, just always keeping an eye on what's going on and just how the girls are reacting to the crowds," says Junkans.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/yy-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23101"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23101" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/yy-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>

"Sometimes if they get more overwhelmed then… we just need to get away from the area for a little bit, but they amaze me at their ability to just shake it off and keep seeing what we are there to see."

But what about the girl's romantic lives? Do either of them have a boyfriend?


Conjoined Twins: Romance

<h3>Though both have expressed a desire to one day get married and have children, they have been reluctant to discuss this issue publicly.</h3>
Obviously, the subject inspires a lot of curiosity among strangers, which is perhaps why they don’t like to talk about it. And of course, it would raise a number of different ethical issues.

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tyu-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22105"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tyu-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/JVVSEs">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
"We share a reproductive system that is fully functional," said Abby. "Not that it's really anyone's business, but we are both capable of producing a child all our own."

"In our specific case, we share a uterus and reproductive track," Brittany added. "But we each have our own ovary with our own eggs. So we each could be a mom."

But what about rumors that Brittany got engaged and has been planning a secret wedding?


<h3>"I was never engaged," said Brittany. "And both of us are single at this time."</h3>
Even if marriage isn’t in the cards in the near future, the one thing Abby and Brittany Hensel never lack is companionship. And both seem to be happy living their lives together the way they always have.

"If God sees fit that one or both us are to be married, then that's how it will go," said Abby matter-of-factly. "Same goes for having children. We just leave it up to our father in heaven. Life is so much easier that way."

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/p-1-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22106"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22106" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/p-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/nt6TYg">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
And according to the girls, you can't believe everything you read on the internet.

What's the craziest thing that's been said about the girls that's absolutely not true?

Conjoined Twins: Crazy Gossip!

<h3>"If we each had a quarter for every untrue thing written about us online, believe me, we wouldn't be doing the TLC show. We'd have already retired," Abby said, laughing.</h3>
These amazing women have overcome so many challenges to build the life that they enjoy today. It's truly inspiring to witness their fortitude, grace, and humor!

<a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d-3-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23103"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23103" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d-3-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>
<h5><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/gVcppu">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
"I think the craziest thing I've read was that Brittany wanted to be boy," said Abby. "And that she was mad at me because she wanted to get a sex change and I didn't. That's probably the most inventive thing I've seen."

"Or the thing about us fighting over a guy," Brittany added. "This one story had us fighting with each other at a McDonald's over this guy that we both liked. The story said I was 'insanely jealous.'"

But you have to wonder, has anything like that ever happened?


Conjoined Twins: Love Lives

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Hensel twins have always been notoriously coy about discussing details of their love lives with the public. However, Brittany did share one detail recently that ruffled her sister Abby's feathers.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Let's just say that we've both had our fair share of kisses over the years," said Brittany. "There's no need to fight over something there's plenty of in the first place."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-2-1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23104"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23104" src="http://brainsation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/r-2-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>

<h5 style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="https://goo.gl/images/be9gcn">Image Credit</a></em></h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Oh my god," Abby chimed in. "We usually don't talk about stuff like this, but Brittany likes to shock. It's true, though."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So apparently the girls are doing quite alright! It's wonderful to see these adorable women overcome steep odds, enjoy life, and share their kindness and charisma with the rest of us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are truly a blessing!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What do these bright young girls inspire you to do?</strong></p>
