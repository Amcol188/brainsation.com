### As they embark on their working life together, the twins aim to take things day by day and keep their expectations to a minimum.

With their position as teachers, they have become role models for children academically, but also in their attitude to life.

“I don’t think there’s anything that they won’t try or something that they couldn’t be able to do if they really wanted to,” says Paul Good, principal of the school where Abby and Brittany work.

But not everyone was quite so thrilled about the Hensel twins taking a teaching gig…

### “People are not always so nice,” said Abby. “Human beings, by their very nature, are curious. So it’s understandable when people stare or ask to have their picture taken with us. That’s fine for the most part.”

Brittany was quick to add, “But sometimes they say hurtful things, and if you let it, it can get you down.”

After the Hensel twins accepted their part-time position teaching elementary school, some parents made disparaging comments on the school’s Facebook page.

“How are you going to let these freaks teach our children,” one woman posted. “Why couldn’t the district just have hired a regular teacher and been done with it?”

But despite the controversy, the girls are thankful that they have one special friend to look out for them…

### As a close friend of the twins, Erin Junkans says you always need to be alert because you never quite know how people are going to react or what they are going to say.

“I want to make sure that they’re safe and that they’re not completely exposed, just always keeping an eye on what’s going on and just how the girls are reacting to the crowds,” says Junkans.

“Sometimes if they get more overwhelmed then… we just need to get away from the area for a little bit, but they amaze me at their ability to just shake it off and keep seeing what we are there to see.”

But what about the girl’s romantic lives? Do either of them have a boyfriend?
