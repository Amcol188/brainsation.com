### In 2008, Abby and Brittany began college at Bethel University, majoring in education. At first, the girls wanted to specialize in different fields, but upon learning about the additional coursework, they decided against it.

“What’s funny, is that when we were little, I wanted to be a pilot,” said Abby. “And Brittany wanted to be a dentist. That didn’t last long.”

Their time at the University proved to be both rewarding and challenging as it is for most young people.

“Of course, at first people would stare because they weren’t familiar with us yet,” said Brittany with a smile. “But pretty much everyone adapted really quick. We always got invited to parties and social things. Abby is really more of a home body than me, but that’s okay, we compromised.”

But there’s one thing that they weren’t prepared to compromise on…

### “We definitely have different styles,” says Abby. “Brittany’s a lot more into neutrals and pearls, stuff like that. But I would rather have it be more fun and bright and colorful!”

While Abby is seen as the “outspoken” sister and will always win the argument about what they are going to wear, Brittany says her twin also has a softer side.

“She’s really sensitive,” said Brittany. “People don’t usually realize that.”

There are other differences too. Brittany is scared of heights, whereas Abby is not. Abby is interested in math and science, while Brittany prefers the arts.

But that’s not all that’s different between the girls…
