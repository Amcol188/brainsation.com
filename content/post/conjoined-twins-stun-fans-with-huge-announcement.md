### For obvious reasons, Abby and Brittany Hensel have had to live as a team. Each girl controls one half of their body, so even the simple act of walking has to be coordinated.

In fact, this is harder than it sounds because Brittany is a few inches shorter than Abby, requiring her to basically tip-toe.

That’s not all the girls have to deal with as a team. Using the restroom, bathing, and personal hygiene issues have to be jointly dealt with.

“It’s a chore, sometimes,” Brittany said while Abby shook her head, agreeing.

Conjoined twins are exceedingly rare – it is thought one in every 200,000 births – and around 40-60% of these births are delivered stillborn. Female siblings tend to have a better survival rate than male siblings, though.

But the girls recently made a huge announcement that stunned their fans…

### The twins recently announced that they had found work as part-time elementary school teachers.

“We are fourth- and fifth-grade math specialists, so we’ll have two classes of math,” said Abby.

“It’s part time, which is nice, so we’ll be kind of transitioning into the teaching world,” Brittany added.

Patty said that she thinks her daughters made an excellent decision by working with children.

“They’ve just always had a knack with kids, and kids have always been kind of drawn to them. Maybe it started by curiosity, but then once their simple questions are answered, they still are just drawn to Ab and Brit,” she said.

But what’s their major concern about their new job?
