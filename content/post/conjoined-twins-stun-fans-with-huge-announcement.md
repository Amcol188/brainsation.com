### Though both have expressed a desire to one day get married and have children, they have been reluctant to discuss this issue publicly.

Obviously, the subject inspires a lot of curiosity among strangers, which is perhaps why they don’t like to talk about it. And of course, it would raise a number of different ethical issues.

“We share a reproductive system that is fully functional,” said Abby. “Not that it’s really anyone’s business, but we are both capable of producing a child all our own.”

“In our specific case, we share a uterus and reproductive track,” Brittany added. “But we each have our own ovary with our own eggs. So we each could be a mom.”

But what about rumors that Brittany got engaged and has been planning a secret wedding?

### “I was never engaged,” said Brittany. “And both of us are single at this time.”

Even if marriage isn’t in the cards in the near future, the one thing Abby and Brittany Hensel never lack is companionship. And both seem to be happy living their lives together the way they always have.

“If God sees fit that one or both us are to be married, then that’s how it will go,” said Abby matter-of-factly. “Same goes for having children. We just leave it up to our father in heaven. Life is so much easier that way.”

And according to the girls, you can’t believe everything you read on the internet.

What’s the craziest thing that’s been said about the girls that’s absolutely not true?

### “If we each had a quarter for every untrue thing written about us online, believe me, we wouldn’t be doing the TLC show. We’d have already retired,” Abby said, laughing.

These amazing women have overcome so many challenges to build the life that they enjoy today. It’s truly inspiring to witness their fortitude, grace, and humor!

“I think the craziest thing I’ve read was that Brittany wanted to be boy,” said Abby. “And that she was mad at me because she wanted to get a sex change and I didn’t. That’s probably the most inventive thing I’ve seen.”

“Or the thing about us fighting over a guy,” Brittany added. “This one story had us fighting with each other at a McDonald’s over this guy that we both liked. The story said I was ‘insanely jealous.'”

But you have to wonder, has anything like that ever happened?

### The Hensel twins have always been notoriously coy about discussing details of their love lives with the public. However, Brittany did share one detail recently that ruffled her sister Abby’s feathers.

“Let’s just say that we’ve both had our fair share of kisses over the years,” said Brittany. “There’s no need to fight over something there’s plenty of in the first place.”

“Oh my god,” Abby chimed in. “We usually don’t talk about stuff like this, but Brittany likes to shock. It’s true, though.”

So apparently the girls are doing quite alright! It’s wonderful to see these adorable women overcome steep odds, enjoy life, and share their kindness and charisma with the rest of us.

They are truly a blessing!
