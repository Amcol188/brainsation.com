### The Hensel twins also respond differently to coffee. After a few cups Brittany’s heart rate increases, but Abby is not affected. They also have different body temperatures!

“I can be a totally different temperature than Brittany,” said Abby. “A lot of times our hands are different temperatures and I get super hot way faster.”

And despite the fact that the twins share an immune system, Brittany tends to get sick more often than Abby.

“It’s because she’s sweeter and the germs are just more attracted to her,” said Abby, laughing at her sister. “She’s just unlucky she’s so nice!”

As the girls have aged, they have had to undergo several other surgeries, including one to stop the growth of Abby’s spine after Brittany stopped growing.

“We’ve both been through a lot health-wise,” said Abby, laughing. “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. Or at least more feisty.”

And the girls have had a lot of experience working together, solving problems, and making due with “what God gave \[them\].”

Some of the most intimate, private experiences a person can have must be coordinated by the girls…
