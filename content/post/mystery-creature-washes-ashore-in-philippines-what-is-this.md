Something is going on in the lightless depths of our oceans and seas. For months now, various seaside communities have been witnesses to the sudden arrival of washed-up corpses of mysterious or extremely rare marine creatures. The trend actually began several years ago in England when a previously unknown organism that looked like a cross between an alligator and a sturgeon.

[Midland Reporter-Telegram](https://www.mrt.com/weird/article/Mysterious-Nessie-like-sea-creature-washes-up-12764833.php) This was followed by the depositing of an ancient species of sturgeon on the expansive beach of Island Beach State Park in New Jersey in the first week of May.

[NJ.com](https://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width600/img/ocean_impact/photo/STURGEON03.jpg) Now, writes [Science Alert](https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-hairy-globster-washes-ashore-philippines-unidentified-sea-monster-whale), a massive and mysterious creature has arrived on the beaches of Oriental Mindoro, a province in the Philippines' Mimaropa region. On May 11, beachgoers and locals beheld a disturbing scene. A shaggy, white creature, appearing to be about twenty-feet long, lay dead on the shore. Its appearance baffled witnesses and even marine experts who arrived on the scene.

[Science Alert](https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-hairy-globster-washes-ashore-philippines-unidentified-sea-monster-whale) ''I couldn't believe what it was, I've never seen anything like it," local woman Imelda Mariz told The Sun. "In God's name, I was shocked. The children were scared it was a dead monster. Nobody knows what it is yet.'' Vox Krusada, a fishery law enforcement officer, quickly traveled to the scene and began studying the creature as well as taking DNA samples. While the monster could not be identified by those who saw it or studied, guesses abounded but one thing garnered universal consensus... the horrid and putrid smell coming from the beast.

"Damn it smells awful. It smells like something from another planet," Krusada said. "I really experienced the full power of its smell because I'm the one who took the tissue samples. I almost puked. I felt better after taking a bath but the stench still lingers in my nose.'' Unable to immediately identify the creature, it has become known as a ‘globster’. Last year, the Philippines witnessed another strange sea creature washing ashore but was quickly guessed to be a dugong (aka sea cow) but after further analysis it was found to be a whale, “although the exact species was never determined”, writes Science Alert.

Left unburied were concerns among some residents about what the monster’s appearance portends. ''An earthquake is heading for Oriental Mindoro," resident Tam Maling told The Sun. "The big globster is a sign of something bad coming. Please pray for us.''
