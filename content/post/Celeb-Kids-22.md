Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick tried their best to keep their daughter Sosie far away from the flashing lights of Hollywood while she was growing up.

“We just know how hard this industry is,” said Kevin Bacon. “And we didn’t want her to get caught up in all the crazy stuff that goes on.”

However, it seems like the proverbial apple didn’t fall very far from the tree.

Although her parents were initially opposed to her pursing an acting career, Sosie accepted a role in The Closer and appeared in four episodes alongside her mother, who played the role of Chief Johnson.

Sosie also portrayed the character of Skye Miller in the TV series 13 Reasons Why.
