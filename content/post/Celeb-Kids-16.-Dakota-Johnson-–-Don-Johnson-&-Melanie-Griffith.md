You know, there was once a time when Dakota Johnson was simply known as the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. These days, however, she’s just as famous as her parents, if not even more so.

Thanks in part to her role as Anastasia Steele in the hit novel-turned-movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Antonio Banderas’ stepdaughter has really made a name for herself.

Johnson was primarily raised in Aspen and Woody Creek, Colorado, where she worked at the local grocery store as a young teenager.

Though acting keeps her pretty busy these days, she has also modeled for MANGO brand jeans in 2009 and Australian fashion house Wish in 2011.

Remember rocker Lenny Kravitz and Cosby Show alum Lisa Bonet?

Well, their daughter is all grown up and doing some pretty big things…
