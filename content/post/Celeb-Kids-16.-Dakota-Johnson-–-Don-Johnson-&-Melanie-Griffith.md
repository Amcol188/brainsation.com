You know, there was once a time when Dakota Johnson was simply known as the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. These days, however, she’s just as famous as her parents, if not even more so.

Thanks in part to her role as Anastasia Steele in the hit novel-turned-movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Antonio Banderas’ stepdaughter has really made a name for herself.
