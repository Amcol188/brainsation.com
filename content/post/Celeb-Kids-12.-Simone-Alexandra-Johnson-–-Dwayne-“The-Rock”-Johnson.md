Simone Alexandra Johnson is the daughter of wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Although she can often be seen with her father attending award shows, Simone likes to keep a low profile.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, “The Rock” stated that he is blessed to have a daughter like Simone.

“I’m so proud of Simone for keeping her private life private,” her father said. “She’s such a mature girl for her age.”
