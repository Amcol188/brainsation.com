It takes a lot of hard work and training to become a doctor. But to become a doctor with your own television show? Now that's tough. Thankfully, our favorite medical media personalities seem to earn back what they put into their programs (and then some)! Ever wondered what Dr. Phil earns in a year, or the net worth of hunky former _Bachelor_ contestant Travis Stork? We've got the dirt!

Dr. Phil Had A Humble Beginning...
----------------------------------

Dr. Phil McGraw -- better known as just plain old Dr. Phil -- is one of the best-known and original television self-help gurus. After earning his PhD in clinical psychology at the University of North Texas, he got his start in showbiz by working as a legal consultant for Oprah in the mid-90s. By 2002, he had his own show, which continues to be extremely popular. How much does he make? Find out on the next slide.

...With A Lucrative Ending

Dr. Phil isn't just one of the world's richest celebrity doctors -- he's one of the world's richest celebrities, period. In 2015, _Forbes_ estimated his annual income at $70 million per year, making him the 15th-highest paid celebrity that year. In 2016, his total net worth was valued over $400 million. You know our next doctor, and while he's not as rich as Dr. Phil, he's worth more than you think!

The Son Of Turkish Immigrants

Like Dr. Phil before him, Dr. Mehmet Oz got his start by appearing on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ before getting his own network programming. He earned his MD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, specializing in cardiothoracic surgery. Now, he rakes in the big bucks, often by touting controversial remedies...

A Little Too Popular?
---------------------

Dr. Oz has been ranked among the most influential people in the world by both _Time_ and _Esquire_ magazines. Between his television appearances, books, and sponsorships, he earns about $4 million every year. He has an estimated net worth somewhere between $7 million and $14 million, even after he was called into a U.S. Senate hearing on consumer protection.

Paging Dr. Love, Anyone?
------------------------

Dr. Travis Stork got his media debut in a rather unusual way for a doctor: He was the hunky candidate on season 8 of _The Bachelor_. Even though the romance didn't work out for him, the cameras certainly loved him. After a few appearances on _Dr. Phil_, he was chosen to host _The Doctors _in 2007.

Smart, Handsome, Rich... And Still Single
-----------------------------------------

Just 45 years old, Dr. Stork is now worth an estimated $8 million. That's not bad for the son of Midwestern farmers who graduated magna cum laude from Duke University. Two of his books, _The Lean Belly Prescription _and _The Doctor's Diet_, have both made the _New York Times_ Best Seller List. You've seen our next doctor just about everywhere, but we bet you don't know how much he has packed away!

Medical Journalist Extraordinaire
---------------------------------

[Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dr._Sanjay_Gupta.jpg)

Dr. Sanjay Gupta is best known as the chief medical correspondent for CNN and a frequent talking head on shows like _60 Minutes_, the _Late Show with David Letterman_, and _The Daily Show with Jon Stewart_. But his resume runs deeper than that: He completed his schooling at the University of Michigan and is a practicing neurosurgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. With all that and more, he earns a pretty penny for his family.

No Thanks, Obama
----------------

![](http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sanjay_guptamake-1496857033101-1.jpg)

[Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanjay_Gupta@MAKE.jpeg)

A neurosurgeon, a journalist, a professor, and even a bestselling novelist, Dr. Gupta is reported to have a $4.5 million net worth. In 2008, he was even considered for the U.S. Surgeon General position under Barack Obama -- but turned down the job, content to focus on his family and current career. You've probably been wondering when Dr. Drew is going to show up on the list ...

Love On The Line With Dr. Drew
------------------------------

Drew Pinsky, M.D. -- better known as Dr. Drew -- got his start in media while still a medical student. He started his popular radio show _Loveline _back in the mid-1980s, and continued to host it until 2016. He's also well known for his television appearances, such as _Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew_, and together he makes quite the decent living doing it.

All That And A Family Man, Too
------------------------------

All told, Dr. Drew's net worth is somewhere in the ballpark of $20 million. He lives in Pasadena, California, with his wife and teenaged triplets. Along with his media work, he continues to serve as a private practitioner, too. But like the rest of the TV doctors on this list, he definitely owes a debt to the woman on the next slide.

Getting Some Since 1980
-----------------------

  The lovable Dr. Ruth Westheimer was a pioneer in the sex education world. She started broadcasting her first radio program, _Sexually Speaking_, on WYNY-FM in 1980. Eventually, the show went national and she got her own weeknight talk show, too. Now 89 years young, she continues to live and teach in New York City.

An Unthinkable Past
-------------------

Between her many popular books, programs, and lectures, Dr. Ruth rests easy on a $3 million net worth. She's been married three times and has two kids. Born to a Jewish German family in 1928, she managed to escape Nazi rule by fleeing to Switzerland. Her parents, unfortunately, were not so lucky.

The New Age Guru

Dr. Deepak Chopra is one of the most well-known figures of the New Age and holistic medicine movement. After earning his M.D. in his native India, he immigrated to the U.S. and completed his residency in New Jersey. He developed a huge following after appearing on -- you guessed it -- _The Oprah Winfrey Show_.

Natural Medicine, Natural Money
-------------------------------

![](http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/290768422_54203c90f9_b-1496857656158-1.jpg)

Chopra is the author of over 80 books, 21 of which have gone on to become bestsellers. He's also a regular contributor to the_ Washington_ _Post _and _Huffington Post_. He left his job at the New England Memorial Hospital in 1985 in order to found the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and it seems to have worked out for him so far: He's worth $50 million today.

A Little Supplement To Start Your Day
-------------------------------------

If you're looking for someone to blame for the aisles of nutritional supplements now rampant in every grocery store across America, it's probably Dr. Andrew Weil. He's a big believer in holistic health and integrative medicine. He studied at Harvard Medical School, but is very critical of traditional medicine. Turns out, so are many people willing to pay for his products.

Take A Walk On The Alternative Side
-----------------------------------

![](http://newsattorneys.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4874376905_dd090df350_b-1496857901904-1.jpg)

Dr. Weil is worth an estimated $10 million today. His many appearances on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_, _The Today Show_, and _Larry King Live_ helped bring his alternative health messages to a broader audience. His website _Ask Dr. Weil_ was named one of _Forbes_' "Best of the Web" in 2009. Alternative medicine pays well, but how about couple's therapy? Can you guess who's up next?

A Divorced Marriage Therapist

Just how much Dr. Jenn makes in a year we can't completely say, but one thing's for sure: she's not strapped for cash. Her parents, songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, are worth a combined $100 million. And in her divorce settlement, ex-beau Joshua Berman received more than $588,000.
