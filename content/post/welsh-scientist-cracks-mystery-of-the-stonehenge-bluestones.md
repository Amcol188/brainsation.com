It has stood for somewhere between 4,000 to 5,000 years amidst the verdant expanse of a Wiltshire field in England. It has weathered millenniums of raw English seasons, storms, rare earthquakes and even the urban sprawl of man.

It was erected, so we are told, to unlock the mysteries of the heavens and to note the cycles of nature. Thousands of years after its creation, Stonehenge now offers more mysteries than answers. According to a history infused with myth, the monolithic bluestones of the site’s outer sanctum, each standing 13 feet high and having a width of seven feet, were hauled from a quarry site in Pembrokeshire, Wales, which is 140 miles away. The trek between the two points is littered with hills, woods, lakes and rivers.  Needless to say, it would have been a Herculean chore.

Egyptian engravings, papyri and surviving quarries detail how such stones were cut and transported enormous distances. “There’s little reason to believe something similar could not also be done in stone-age Britain.” Paleo-archaeologists have also shown that there were methods in use by people back then to do just this sort of task.

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Druids_celebrating_at_Stonehenge_(1).png) All of this is ‘poppycock’ says Dr. Brian John, a Welsh scientist, in a new book he has written about the site’s bluestones. Previous writings by John have dismissed the Pembrokeshire quarry site as nothing more than an ‘entirely natural’ process. Now, John is asserting that the Neolithic society in and around the area of Stonehenge did not need to travel over a hundred miles to lug back massive slabs of quarried stone. That’s because the stones were already present. Around 500,000 years ago, says John, a wall of slowly advancing ice called the Irish Sea Glacier swept up the large stones from Pembrokeshire and deposited them at the current location.

[PublicDomainPictures.net](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=15936&picture=tracy-arm-fjord-glacier) When the ice retreated during a warming phase, societies began to flourish, with one collection of humanity using the left behind stones to construct Stonehenge. “The story of bluestones transported by the vast Irish Sea Glacier is every bit as wonderful as the archetypal myth of Neolithic Argonauts struggling to move heavy stones with the aid of crude tools, heavy sledges and flimsy rafts,” John said. John sees himself as trying to right a historical and geological record warped by the media.

[From Dr Johnson's Website](https://brian-mountainman.blogspot.com/) “Over the past 50 years there has been a drift, in Stonehenge studies, from science towards mythology. This has been driven partly by constant media demands for new and spectacular stories about the monument,” he told local media this week. “This has been driven partly by constant media demands for new and spectacular stories about the monument, and partly by the archaeological emphasis on impact,” he says. “So we see an obsession with narrative at the expense of evidence, and a host of newly manufactured myths which are even more wacky than the old ones. It’s time for a cool reassessment.”
