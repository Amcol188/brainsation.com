The discovery prompted the inevitable comparisons to _Breaking Bad_and _Los Pollos Hermanos_.

Countless news stories relayed the tunnel’s dimensions: three feet wide, five feet tall, and about 600 feet long.

The local news constantly repeated the sensational figure that “more than $1 million worth of cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin” had been found the day before on Lopez.

“We’re the largest border city in Arizona with almost 38,000 people and growing very rapidly,” said Richard Jessup, San Luis Police Chief.

But the tunnel affirmed another unspoken rule on America’s southwest border.

“What can’t go up, must go down,” said Jessup. “Or rather, what can’t go over the wall can and will go under it.”

This wasn’t the first tunnel, and it certainly wasn’t the most sophisticated one to be discovered along the border…

## BUT THIS WASN’T THE FIRST TUNNEL IN SAN LUIS

{{< ad_infeed >}}

The KFC tunnel was simply the latest passaged to be uncovered in an ongoing game of drug-trafficking whack-a-mole that has literally gone underground.

“Unusual? Yes. But surprising? No,” said Police Chief Richard Jessup.

Another tunnel had been found in the city in 2012, also close to the former KFC.

Jessup was quick to note that there is already a border wall that spans far beyond San Luis city limits, comprised of not one, but two twenty-foot-tall fences.

“It’s very difficult in our area to get over that wall. You either are going to take a drone and fly it over or you are going to try to tunnel underneath it,” Jessup said.

But just how successful are the drug traffickers’ efforts?

You might be surprised…
