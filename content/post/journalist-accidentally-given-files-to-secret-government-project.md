A people should never fear their government, for that is tyranny. The opposite, the government fearing the people, is the guarantor of freedom. Unfortunately, we suffer under the ‘aegis’ of a meddling centralized government masquerading as a benevolent patriarch. Agencies like the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Security Agency to name a few, operate in the shadows of unconstitutionality and violations of human rights.

There have been those who have lost their lives investigating these shadows, journalists like Danny Casolaro, Michael Hastings and independent investigators like Victor Thorn. Occasionally such efforts bear fruit, but a recent inquiry by another journalist, Curtis Waltman, may have unearthed a very disturbing project possibly being conducted by our government.

**Foiled by FOIA** Waltman was in the midst of investigating the activities of Antifa and White Supremacist groups in Washington State when he issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for relevant documents held by the state’s DHS intelligence fusion center. https://twitter.com/MuckRock/status/986697321286131712 What he got in the stack of papers were a few pages containing diagrams and notes about the electromagnetic effects of psycho-electronic weapons on the human body, reports [BoingBoing.Net](https://boingboing.net/2018/04/19/government-accidentally-sends.html).

**Side Effects Include…** The documents were embedded in a computer file named ‘EM effects on human body.zip.’  The file also had documents pertaining to remote mind control, with a note on one stating that the “first unclassified successful transmission of the human voice directly into the skull of a living person was performed by DP Joseph C. Sharp of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in 1974.”

According to the document, an agency was using an Oliver [Lowery](https://pythagoreanorderofdeath.ning.com/profiles/blogs/silent-sound-and-voice-to-skull) silent sound device (U.S. patent 5,159,703) to embed subliminal messages hidden in electronic communications into the minds of victims by a process called the [Smirnov Scramble](https://psychophysical-torture.de.tl/Igor-Smirnov.htm).

Russian scientist Igor Smirnov developed a way to imperceptible messages into the brains of humans via background music and, it is believed, television broadcasts. The messages could not be discerned externally but were deciphered automatically by the brain. It is believed that the result could leave people thinking they hear voices in their head.

Waltman’s unexpected cache of information includes a document listing “various forms of torment supposedly made possible by using remote mind-control methods, from ‘forced memory blanking’ and ‘sudden violent itching inside eyelids’ to ‘wild flailing’ followed by ‘rigor mortis’ and a remotely induced ‘forced orgasm.’ It was not immediately clear how the documents wound up in the agency’s response to a standard FOIA request, but there was reportedly no indication the ‘remote mind control’ files stemmed from any government program.”

**Mind Your Government** While the Waltman documents do not have the fingerprints of the American government on it, there is still strong reason to believe that Uncle Sam is more like a manipulative Big Brother. Popular Mechanics, quoted by BoingBoing, asserts that the “federal government has absolutely experimented with mind control in a variety of methods.” The most famous revealed experiment was the CIA’s ‘MKULTRA’ program which used hallucinogenic drugs and methods of ‘mind control’ to change the behavior of individuals.

So, who is scared of whom?
