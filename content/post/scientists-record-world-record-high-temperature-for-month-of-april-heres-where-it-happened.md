As the debate about climate change rages on, scientists are offering some new evidence to the argument in the form of extreme temperature recordings. This latest one comes from Pakistan where scientists documented a world record temperature for the month of April. The temperature was recorded at a weather station in Nawabshah, Pakistan, where it was 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade!

Weather-Forecast.com\[/caption\] From [IFLScience](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/scientists-record-hottest-april-temperature-ever-anywhere-on-earth/): It's only May, and this year is setting new standards in terrifying extreme temperatures. The latest example comes from Nawabshah, Pakistan, where it was 50.2ºC (122.4ºF) on April 30. Meteorologists think this is the hottest shaded temperature ever recorded for a reliable weather station in April, anywhere on Earth. The World Meteorological Organization does not provide an official account of monthly temperature records for the planet, so the claim this is the hottest April temperature ever can't be absolutely confirmed.

Moreover, in April 2001 the city of Santa Rosa, Mexico, reported an even higher 51.0ºC (123.8ºF), but the Weather Underground's Dr Christopher Burt described this to the Washington Post as “of dubious reliability”. No other challenger has been found. Records such as this don't happen in isolation. Most of Pakistan and much of India have been experiencing weather that would be extreme for July, so is off the charts for spring-time. The effect is being driven by an enormous mass of hot water in the north-eastern Indian Ocean. Not all of the extreme temperatures being recorded around the globe right now are on the hot side. Just a few months ago, Europeans had to endure the "Beast From the East," a weather system that plunged temperatures 13 degrees below normal, while temperatures in the arctic were 3 degrees above the average.
