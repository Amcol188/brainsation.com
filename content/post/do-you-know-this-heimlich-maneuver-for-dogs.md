It seems most humans love their dogs more than they love themselves. Well, at least we usually treat our dog's bodies better than our own. We put off doctor visits for ourselves, but never miss one for out pets. And while we make sure they have the best pet food we can give them, we "wolf down" (pun intended) whatever food is fast and convenient. This technique started making the rounds on the Internet after a Twitter user whose dog had choked on a piece of plastic Tweeted out instructions.

They can often panic if they begin to suffocate. In the worst case scenario, they can even fall unresponsive or unconscious. So, if you notice any of these signs, try these four steps: Assess the situation:

Check their mouth and throat by placing your finger in their mouth and sweeping it from side to side. Give them a “sharp blow” to the shoulder blades. Hold up their hind legs as high as you can and tilt them down like a wheelbarrow. Compress the abdomen by pushing up with your fist. Failing that, call your vet immediately.

If you don’t know the human Heimlich maneuver, you really should learn it. This fool-proof method was first described in 1974 by US surgeon Dr Henry Heimlich.**

> First, if you notice someone is choking on an object in their trachea, try giving up to five firm blows between their shoulder blades with the palm of your hand. If the object remains lodged, stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist. Place your clenched fist just above the person’s navel. Grab your fist with your other hand. Quickly pull inward and upward, a bit like you’re trying to lift the person up. Perform this type of abdominal thrust a total of five times.

Several notable celibrities such as Cher, Ronald Reagan, Ellen Barkin, and Elizabeth Taylor have had their lives saved by the Heimlich maneuver. As recently as 2014, actor Clint Eastwood even used the technique to save the life of a PGA Tour official at the AT&T Pro-Am Golf Tournament.
