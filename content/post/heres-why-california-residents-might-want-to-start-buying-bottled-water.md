Day-by-day, California is getting closer to running out of drinking water. In the wealthiest nation on Earth, it is inconceivable that this should be happening.

Adversity being the mother of invention, the [SFGate](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Recycled-water-from-sewer-OK-d-for-California-12735732.php) reports that San Diego is hoping its’ experiment in recycled water will trickle throughout the Golden State.

On March 6 the California State Water Resources Control Board gave San Diego the greenlight using highly treated sewage water in its’ reservoir. There are 36 reservoirs in California that serve as sources of municipal drinking water for residents.

“This is a type of indirect potable use — it's not treated recycle water that goes directly to someone's house,” said Miryam Barajas at the Water Board. “It's highly treated.” Barajas said San Diego is leading the state in infrastructure to begin carrying out a sewer-to-reservoir operation but the rest of the state will likely follow.  Years of drought and prior agreements with Las Vegas to pipe water to Sin City have sucked California almost dry. For quite a while now, California has had mandatory restrictions on water usage aimed at limiting wasteful water usage. Violators of the rules were fined $500.

SFGate writes that water “recycling is part of the California Water Action Plan and Senate bills 918 and 322” that order the Water Board to investigate creating regulations for direct and indirect potable reuse. The Water Board has purportedly funded more than $748 million worth of water recycling projects last year

Barajas says the solution is not to be found just in laws. “The regulations are now there but the infrastructure is not,” she said.

So, for two years, San Diego conducted scientific reviews, hosted experts and studied environmental and health impact statements in an effort to create an efficient water recycling program. It is expected that the regulations will be perfected and the system set up to run by 2023.
