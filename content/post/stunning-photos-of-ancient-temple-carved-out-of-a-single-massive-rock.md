The Temple at Kailasa is a marvel to behold. The giant structure, 164 feet deep, 109 feet wide, and 98 feet high, is one of the biggest monolithic structures in the world. And, by "monolithic" we mean that the whole thing was carved out of a single rock.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailasa_temple,_Ellora#/media/File:Kailasha.JPG) The legend goes that a local king in India suffered from a serious, debilitating disease. His wife offered up a prayer to the Hindu god Ghrishneshwar (Shiva) to cure her husband and, as part of her bargain to save him, vowed to build a temple if he was healed of his disease. What's more, she promised to fast until the project was completed. Multiple architects looked at the project and concluded that it would take months to complete, but one architect, Kokosa, said that he could complete the project in a matter of weeks and allow the queen to complete her fast.

[Wiki Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aurangabad,ellora_kailash_temple.jpg) Sure enough, as the legend goes, he built the temple from the top down by carving it out of a single rock, completing it so that the queen could complete her fast and fulfill her obligation to the diety for saving her husbands's life. Upon completion, the temple was named after the queen, Manikeshwar. From [Ancient Code](https://ancient-code.com/ancient-kailasa-temple-exposed-60-mind-bending-images-temple-carved-mountain/):

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=794937) _"The Kailasa temple in Ellora, Maharashtra, India is a MEGALITH carved out of a SINGLE rock. It is considered as one of the most remarkable cave temples in India, mostly because of its humongous size, architecture and sculptural implementations. In other words, it is one of the many places on Earth that proves how ancient societies—around the globe—were extremely advanced in various fields, possessing a knowledge that allowed them to erect—or carve—mind-bending structures that have remained standing for thousands of years after their creation."_

Mainstream scholars tell us that the ancient caves were built sometime around the fifth and tenth centuries AD, but many others disagree suggesting the caves are much older._

[_Wikimedia Commons_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shiva_killing_demon,_entrance_to_Cave_No._16_(Kailasa_Temple),_Ellora_Caves.jpg) _H.P. Blavatsky and M.K. Dhavalikar are just some of the authors who agree that we are looking at serious ancient stuff. M.K. Dhavalikar, who was a notable Indian historian, and archaeologist, author of the book ‘Ellora’, suggests the shrines and the Kailasa temple were not excavated at the same time but are the result of a construction process that belongs to a number of different periods. But it doesn’t really matter that much how–exactly—old these ancient structures are. What baffles experts is their incredible precision and design._ Amazing!
