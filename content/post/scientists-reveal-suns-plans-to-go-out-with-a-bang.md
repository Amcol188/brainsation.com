When it comes time for our Sun to essentially die, it will do so in a brilliant fashion. Following its planned end-of-life explosion 10 billion years from now, an enormous nebulous cloud of dust and gas will swirl throughout the void and, scientists now predict, will radiate a light that will slowly diminish over 100,000 years as the celestial debris coalesces into a white dwarf star.

The [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/sun-death-nebula-star-astronomy-nature-manchester-a8340281.html) reports that a research team from the University of Manchester has published a paper in the journal _Nature Astronomy_, that claims our sun has enough size and energy to produce a dazzling, glittering nebula that will last thousands of years.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NGC7293_(2004).jpg) Professor Albert Zijlstra, one of the Manchester researchers, asserts that when the sun dies, it will expel cosmic flotsam and jetsam that will be illuminated by a very hot core of heated gas. “It is only then the hot core makes the ejected envelope shine brightly for around 10,000 years – a brief period in astronomy,” he added. “This is what makes the planetary nebula visible.”

The required shielding material is so precise that a dead star just a fraction smaller than our Sun would not have enough 'oomph' to provide luminescence. Of the study and published paper, Professor Zijlstra said: “This is a nice result. Not only do we now have a way to measure the presence of stars of ages a few billion years in distant galaxies, which is a range that is remarkably difficult to measure, we even have found out what the sun will do when it dies. “Problem solved, after 25 years.”
