### "People are not always so nice," said Abby. "Human beings, by their very nature, are curious. So it's understandable when people stare or ask to have their picture taken with us. That's fine for the most part."

Brittany was quick to add, "But sometimes they say hurtful things, and if you let it, it can get you down."

After the Hensel twins accepted their part-time position teaching elementary school, some parents made disparaging comments on the school's Facebook page.

"How are you going to let these freaks teach our children," one woman posted. "Why couldn't the district just have hired a regular teacher and been done with it?"

But despite the controversy, the girls are thankful that they have one special friend to look out for them...

### As a close friend of the twins, Erin Junkans says you always need to be alert because you never quite know how people are going to react or what they are going to say.

"I want to make sure that they're safe and that they're not completely exposed, just always keeping an eye on what's going on and just how the girls are reacting to the crowds," says Junkans.

But what about the girl's romantic lives? Do either of them have a boyfriend?
